                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	My mom, who churned out many a tasty scone in her day, wasn't so hot on the idea of rhubarb in scones, "too tart, honey." Boy was she ever wrong. Rhubarb's tang is the perfect foil for the super rich scone (I subbed heavy cream for the milk and upped the salt in my mom's recipe, hence the naughty). You almost don't need jam, but if you went that route, strawberry would be a natural, and clotted cream for the full-on naughty experience. - Midge (less) â€”Midge

Food52 Review: WHO: Midge is a journalist, mostly on the travel beat (feel free to envy her). 
WHAT: A cream scone that needs no jam or butter. 
HOW: Slice rhubarb, toss into a quick-leavened dough, pat, slice, bake. 
WHY WE LOVE IT: As long as there's rhubarb to be had, this is our go-to weekend brunch and teatime snack.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 stalks rhubarb</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 1/2 cups flour</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon baking powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 tablespoons butter, unsalted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup vanilla sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2/3 - 3/4 cups cream, heavy</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Preheat oven to 425.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Slice rhubarb stalks 1/4 " thick. Toss with 3 tablespoons of the sugar.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Sift flour, baking powder and salt together in large bowl or bowl of food processor.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Cut butter into flour mixture by hand (or whiz with food processor) until butter is the size of small peas.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Blend in 1/4 cup of the sugar.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Blend in sliced rhubarb. (If using the food processor, just pulse -- you want the slices left mostly intact.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Blend in cream until a soft dough forms. (note: you may need to add more than 2/3 cup depending on the weather,etc.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">8. Transfer dough to floured surface and divide in half. To make triangular scones, flatten into 6-inch disks and cut each circle into 6-8 scones. Sprinkle with remaining sugar.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">9. Arrange on ungreased cookie sheet and bake about 20 minutes or until reddish-brown on top.</span><br />
