                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">130 grams (about 1 cup) flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">15 grams (about 1 tablespoon) sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">7.5 grams (about 1 1/2 teaspoons) baking powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 grams (about (1/2 teaspoon) baking soda</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 grams (about 1/2 teaspoon) salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">28.5 grams (about 2 tablespoons) butter - cultured unsalted, chilled & cut into 1/4-inch cubes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">30 grams cheddar, white, cut into 1/4-inch cubes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons chives, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2/3 cup yogurt, plain</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 eggs, soft boiled</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a food processor, pulse the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt to combine.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Distribute the butter evenly over the flour and pulse 1 full second at a time until the mixture resembles gravel. Add the cheese and pulse a few more times to break up the cheese, but be sure to leave some small chunks.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Transfer this mixture to a bowl and stir in the chives.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Shake (or whisk) the yogurt until it's thin enough to pour.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add the yogurt to the the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. It's okay if it's not 100% incorporated but be careful not to overmix.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Working quickly, put 4 small circles of batter down on the parchment paper and top each one with an egg standing upright. Cover each egg with the remaining batter and place the pan into the pre-heated oven.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bake for 4-5 minutes and then turn down the heat to 400 degrees F (200 C) and bake until the biscuits are golden brown (about another 7-10 minutes).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Serve hot, or transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</span><br />
