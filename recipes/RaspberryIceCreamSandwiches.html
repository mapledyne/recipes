                <span itemprop="description">
	So, my favorite way to eat raspberries is standing in a raspberry bush and popping them straight into my mouth. But, I started thinking about other ways I would like to eat raspberries, ways I haven't even tried yet, and what popped into my mind was raspberry ice cream sandwiches, made with lemon coconut shortbread. I decided to set about making them. They turned out to be everything I hoped they would be! The shortbread is light and soft-crisp and gives way with a nice crunch to the creamy tangy ice cream within. And they're wonderfully messy to eat if you let them get to that nice point where they're squishy and melty and you can squeeze the ice cream out the sides and lick it off before taking another bite. 
The ice cream is creamy and berry-ful. It's based generally off of a basic vanilla ice cream with a whole lot of raspberry puree added, plus a splash of chambord to help keep the ice cream from freezing too hard. The shortbread is based off of a recipe from Bon Appetit with a number of adjustments and some flavor modifications.  (less) —fiveandspice

Food52 Review: WHO: fiveandspice is a Boston-based FOOD52-er whose creative, inspired recipes we can always count on. 
WHAT: A gorgeous, elegant ice cream sandwich that hits a perfect flavor combination. 
HOW: You make an intense raspberry ice cream (whose color comes simply from pureeing and straining the berries), then sandwich it in between toasted coconut-lemon shortbread. 
WHY WE LOVE IT: The cookies are amazing on their own -- fine-crumbed and a little shaggy with coconut and lemon zest -- but they hold together like champs when matched with the ice cream.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cups raspberry puree, strained</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups cream, heavy</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups cream, half and half</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 vanilla bean</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 egg yolks</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon Chambord</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup coconut, unsweetened finely shredded</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups butter, unsalted, soft but still slightly cooler than room temperature</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon sea salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon lemon juice</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 lemons, the zest of 2</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 2/3 cups flour, all-purpose</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. In a small bowl, lightly whisk the egg yolks and set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Add the cream and half and half and sugar to a saucepan. Split the vanilla bean and scrape the insides in. Then toss in the pod, for good measure. Heat just to a simmer.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Add about 1/4 cup of the hot liquid to the egg yolks, whisking furiously to temper the yolks. Add another 1/2 cup, continuing to whisk. Then, scrape the egg mixture into the pot with the rest of the liquid is. Cook, stirring constantly at a low simmer until the mixture thickens to a custard consistency, thick enough to thickly coat the back of a spoon.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Strain the custard into a bowl. Stir in the raspberry puree and Chambord until completely mixed. Refrigerate at least 4 hours (I like to leave mine overnight). Then, churn in an ice cream machine according to your machine's directions, transfer to a container and freeze.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Use to assemble ice cream sandwiches with the cookies, as directed below.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Spread the coconut on a baking sheet. Bake in a 325F oven until just lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool completely.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the butter and the sugar until light and fluffy. Then beat in the salt and lemon juice.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">8. Beat in the flour in two additions, adding the coconut and lemon zest with the second addition. Then beat just until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and forms almost a single mass.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">9. Gather the dough together, flatten it into a disc, wrap it in plastic wrap and chill for at least an hour.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">10. Preheat your oven to 325F. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to about a quarter inch thickness. Use a 2 inch round cookie cutter to cut circles. Transfer the cookies to parchment lined baking sheets.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">11. Gather the remaining dough together, roll it out again and cut more circles. Repeat as needed to cut all the dough (you may have some odd scraps at the end - bake them and snack on them), using as little flour as possible all the while.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">12. Bake the cookies for about 16-20 minutes (rotating each baking sheet halfway through the baking time), or until they are golden brown. Keeo the sheets with uncooked cookies on them in the refrigerator while they wait to bake.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">13. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for about 3 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack and allow them to cool completely.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">14. To assemble the ice cream sandwiches, let the raspberry ice cream soften slightly. Place a scoop of ice cream on top of a cookie. Top with another cookie and press down gently to make a sandwich. Wrap with plastic wrap and place in the freezer.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">15. Repeat until you have used up all of the cookie pairs (or all of the ice cream, whichever comes first, but they were fairly well matched). Let the sandwiches freeze until they are hardened. Then serve. They will also keep wrapped and stored in the freezer (put them in a box of some sort to protect them) for a while, just waiting for when you need them.</span><br />
