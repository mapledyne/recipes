                <span itemprop="description">
	Author Notes: I've gone to a lot of showers -- be they bridal or baby -- over the past few years, and happily, I've either hosted or cooked for a number of them. This frittata has proven to be a winner for this type of gathering. It's quick and springy and manages to toe that elusive line between practical and impeccable. It's the perfect dish when you need to impress but don't want to stress.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 onion, medium, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 bunch asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch pieces</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 cups spring greens, roughly chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">10 large eggs</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons marjoram, chopped fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt and freshly ground pepper</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 ounces cheese, Fontina, cut into small cubes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons chives, fresh, chopped</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Preheat the broiler. In a 12-inch ovenproof non-stick or cast iron skillet, heat the oil over a medium flame. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, for 3 minutes. Add the asparagus, sprinkle with a little bit of salt, and cook, stirring every minute or so, until the asparagus is bright green and barely tender, about 5 minutes. Add the greens and cook, stirring, until just wilted, about 2 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Meanwhile, whisk together the eggs, marjoram and salt and pepper to taste. Pour the egg mixture into the skillet, stir briefly and then cook undisturbed until almost set, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the cheese over the top and put the skillet under the broiler (about 4 inches from the heat) for a couple of minutes, until the eggs have set, and the cheese has melted. Let cool for a few minutes, sprinkle the chives over the top and serve the frittata in wedges.</span><br />
