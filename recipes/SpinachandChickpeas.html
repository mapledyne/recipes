                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	One of the reason I blended recipes was because I wanted the approachability of Ximena’s version but also some of the extras in Moro’s — the vinegar, paprika and the fried bread, mashed to a paste. Except, in hindsight, I think I’d also enjoy this recipe without the bread. It would be a bit thinner and saucier and possibly harder to slop onto a piece of toast, but also a bit lighter — in weight, not just calories. If you’re bread-averse or think you’d enjoy it without the crumbs in the sauce, give it a spin and let us know how it goes.

Tomato sauce, by the way, is emphatically not traditional in this dish but after making Ximena’s version with it — she says “you don’t have to use tomato in this recipe, but it’s so much better with it” — I can’t have it any other way.

Last note: This recipe is flexible. If you end up with a little less spinach or a little more sauce, or if you want it with a little less this or a little more that, so be it. Enjoy it. Have fun with it.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 x 15 ounces cans chickpeas, cooked, drained and rinsed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 tablespoon olive oil, extra-virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound spinach, washed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">A hefty 1-inch slice from a bread,  country loaf or about 2 slices from sandwich loaf, crusts removed and cut inset small cubes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup tomato sauce, (I used canned stuff I keep around)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon cumin, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Pinch of red pepper flakes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 tablespoons vinegar, red wine</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon paprika, smoked</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt and freshly ground black pepper</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Lemon juice, to taste</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place a large saucepan over medium heat and add half the olive oil. When it is hot, add the spinach with a pinch of salt (in batches, if necessary) and stir well. Remove when the leaves are just tender, drain in a colander and set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat 2 more tablespoons olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Fry the bread for about 5 minutes or until golden brown all over, then the remaining tablespoon of oil and the garlic, cumin and pepper. Cook for 1 minute more or until the garlic is nutty brown.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Transfer to a food processor, blender or mortar and pestle along with the vinegar, and mash to a paste. Return the mixture to the pan and add the drained chickpeas and tomato sauce. Stir until the chickpeas have absorbed the flavors and are hot. Season with salt and pepper.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">If the consistency is a little thick, add some water. Add the spinach and cook until it is hot. Check for seasoning and serve with paprika on top, or on fried bread toasts (as the Spanish do).</span><br />
