                <span itemprop="description">
	An involved weekend recipe, but it doubles well if you have a 14-cup food processor, and leftovers re-heat well. Cook the meatballs in two batches if you double. Can be used with spaghetti sauce (instead of the sweet and sour sauce).

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 slice bread, rustic (Bakery Nouveau)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 garlic cloves, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 ounces pepperoni, slices</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces chicken thighs, boneless skinless</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">spinach, frozen, defrosted and squeezed dry</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 onion, small</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon cinammon, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon salt, kosher, Diamond Crystal brand (exact)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">a few grinds pepper black, freshly ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon vinegar, red wine</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 ounce cheese, parmesan</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">zest of 1 lemon</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">For the sauce:</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon olive oil, extra-virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup wine, white  dry, sauvignon blanc or pinot grigio</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons vinegar, red wine</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup chicken broth</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">rice, for serving</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Place the bread in a food processor and grind into crumbs. You should have about 1/2 cup. Remove to a separate large bowl.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Place the garlic and the pepperoni in the food processor and process until very finely chopped.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Add the chicken, spinach, onion, cinnamon, salt and pepper, and process until well mixed. Poke through with a fork or spoon looking for unincorporated chicken chunks, and process further until you don't find any. You're not looking for a mousse texture, but pretty close. Remove to the bowl with the bread crumbs.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Stir in 1 tablespoon vinegar, cheese, lemon zest and egg. With your hands, form the meat mixture into 2-inch meatballs, placing them in a single layer on a large plate. You may cover the meatballs with plastic wrap at this point and place them in the fridge for several hours.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Pour the olive oil into a 12-inch non-stick or cast iron skillet and heat over medium-high. Add the meatballs to the pan and cook until well browned on all sides, turning carefully with tongs. Turn the heat down if they are browning too fast. Cooking will take about 10 minutes. Pour off or blot any excess fat.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Return the heat to medium-high (if necessary) and add the wine. Cook until nearly completely reduced, about 2 minutes. Add the sugar, vinegar, and broth, bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and cover. Simmer 12 to 15 minutes, turning the meatballs once until the meatballs are firm and register between 165 degrees and 170 degrees Fahrenheit in the center.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Remove the meatballs to a bowl, raise the heat to medium-high, and boil the sauce down until it's sour, sweet and salty enough to your taste. Pour over meatballs and serve immediately with rice or noodles.</span><br />
