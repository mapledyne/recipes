                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces pasta, any shape you like</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound summer squash, halved lengthwise and sliced thin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon lemon zest, finely grated (you won’t need this yet, but better to zest before juicing to avoid grumpiness)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 lemon juice</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons butter, unsalted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cloves garlic, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 - 5 scallions, sliced thin and white/pale green parts and dark green tops in separate piles</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Pinches of red pepper flakes, to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups milk, ideally whole but low-fat will also work</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup parsley, flat-leaf, chopped and divided</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon herbs, (I used a mix of thyme, oregano and mint, but if you only have, say, thyme or oregano, a full tables</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt and more pepper to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 cup cheese, parmesan or aged pecorino romano cheese, divided</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 ounces cheese, mozzarella, cut into small cubes</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cook the pasta: If you’ve got an oven-save 3-quart deep skillet or braising pan, use it here and you’ll only need one pot for the whole recipe. Otherwise, bring an medium/large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente, about 1 to 2 minutes before perfect doneness. Drain and set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat oven: To 400 degrees.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Prepare the squash: Heat a large skillet or the pot you just used to cook your pasta to high heat. Once hot, add olive oil, and let it heat until almost smoking. Add sliced squash, season it with salt and pepper flakes and let it sear underneath, unmoved, until golden brown. Continue to saute until browned and somewhat wilted, about 10 minutes, trying to get some color on each layer before moving squash around. Transfer to a bowl and squeeze lemon juice over bowl. Add more salt or pepper if needed.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Make the sauce: Reheat your the same pot over medium heat. Melt butter in bottom of pan. Add scallion white and pale green parts and garlic and let sizzle for 1 to 2 minutes. Add flour and stir until all has been dampened and absorbed. Add milk, a very small splash at a time, stirring the whole time with a spoon. Make sure each splash has been fully mixed into the butter/flour/onion/garlic mixture, scraping from the bottom of the pan and all around, before adding the next splash. Repeat until all milk has been added, then add lemon zest, salt and pepper to taste. Let mixture simmer together for 2 minutes, stirring frequently; the sauce will thicken. Remove pan from heat and stir in half of chopped parsley and all of mixed herbs. Adjust seasoning to taste.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Assemble dish: Off the heat, add drained pasta, summer squash, 1/2 cup grated parmesan and all of the mozzarella to the pot, stirring to combine. If pan is ovenproof, you can bake your final dish in it. If not, transfer mixture to a 2 to 3 quart ovenproof casserole or baking dish. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup parmesan.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bake: For 25 to 30 minutes, until edges of pasta are golden brown and irresistible. Sprinkle with reserved parsley and serve hot. Reheat as needed.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">To freeze: Let dish fully cool to room temperature, then transfer, wrapped well, to the freezer. Let defrost in fridge for a day before rewarming in oven.</span><br />
