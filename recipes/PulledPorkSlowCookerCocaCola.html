                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	Now, my recipe isn’t quite the same as what I had in San Francisco. Obviously, I’ve used Dr Pepper instead of Coke since that’s the soda I enjoy, but feel free to use either one – or any other cola-type soda you prefer.

In addition, I’ve simplified the recipe for the slow cooker, which results in less sticky glaze than The Chairman’s recipe, but more juice – something I prefer with pulled pork.

The resulting pork is outstanding. It’s sweet, salty, and a little bit spicy. While you could use this pulled pork in all sorts of ways (steamed buns, tacos, sandwiches…), I personally enjoyed mounding it on a bun slathered with chili-mayo and topped with sweet-n-sour pickled red onions. Enjoy!

Bonus Tip!

What to do with the leftover liquid from cooking the pork? I actually just leave the liquid in the pot, add some stock or water to thin it out and a cup of dried beans. Let the beans soak overnight and then set the slow cooker once again for 10 hours. The result? Best. Beans. Ever. In fact, I do this often with leftover slow cooker juices.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 teaspoons salt, kosher, divided</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 pounds pork shoulder, boneless or pork butt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons oil, vegetable</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 onions, red, cut into slices</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 12-ounce can Coca Cola</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup brown sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup BBQ sauce, any favorite variety</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons soy sauce</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons honey</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon mustard seeds</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 - 1 teaspoon chili flakes, depending on how spicy you like it</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 teaspoons Worcester sauce</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon liquid smoke</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 garlic cloves, crushed</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Spray the inside of a 6-quart or larger slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Season the pork: Combine 2 teaspoons of the kosher salt and 1/2 teaspoon of the black pepper in a small bowl. Sprinkle it thoroughly over the pork, using extra salt and pepper if needed to generously cover all sides</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Sear the pork: Warm the oil in a large pot, Dutch oven, or cast iron skillet over high heat. Be sure to turn the vent on and throw open the windows as we’re going to create a lot of smoke.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Once the oil is glistening, add the pork. It should sizzle immediately. Sear the pork for 3 to 5 minutes on all sides -- you want a nice golden-brown crust on each side. Don’t force it along. If the pork sticks to the pan, wait another minute or two until it releases easily before turning.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Transfer the seared pork to the slow cooker.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Cook the onions: In the same pot used to sear the pork, add the onions and reduce the heat to medium-high. Cook until the onions soften up and begin to take on bit of color, about 5 minutes. Use the liquid the onions release to scrape up the delicious browned bits on the bottom of the pan as they cook.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Transfer the cooked onions to the slow cooker with the pork.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Add the remaining ingredients to the slow cooker: In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 teaspoon salt, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, the Dr Pepper, brown sugar, BBQ sauce, soy sauce, honey, mustard seeds, chili flakes, Worcester sauce, and liquid smoke (if using). Pour this over the pork and onions. Scatter the crushed garlics around the pork.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">At this point, you can cover the pork and place it in the fridge overnight, or until you're ready to start cooking.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Cook the pork: Place the lid on the slow cooker. Cook for 8 to 10 hours – the longer the better.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Shred the pork and serve: Once the cooking is done, transfer the meat to a large serving dish using tongs. Scoop up all of the cooked onions and smashed garlic as well, as they’ll add a lot of flavor.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Use a pair of forks to tear and shred the pork apart. Stir in some of the cooking liquid, one tablespoon at a time, to make it extra saucy, and serve.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Leftovers will keep for 1 week refrigerated, or up to 3 months frozen.</span><br />
