                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	One of my favorite recipes from my childhood is this ground beef noodle casserole that my grandmother used to make for us when we came for a visit. It has ground beef, egg noodles, black olives, corn, mushrooms, and shredded cheddar cheese. It may sound like an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink kind of recipe, or a midwestern version of tamale pie (corn, olives, mushrooms?), but wow is it good!



It also feeds a crowd, which was perfect for out big family (6 kids), and is relatively budget friendly. I have no idea where my grandmother got the recipe, but I did find her old hand written notes for it, including its name—Talerine. Doing a quick Google search for “talerine” reveals several similar recipes that many people coincidentally got from their grandmothers.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons olive oil, extra-virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 medium onion, white, about 1 1/2 cups, peeled and chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 bell pepper, about 1 cup, seeded, ribs removed, finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3  cloves garlic, minced, about 1 Tbsp</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 28-ounce can tomatoes, whole peeled or crushed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 pounds ground beef</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 ounces mushrooms, sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces egg noodles</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups corn, frozen, defrosted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 15-ounce can olives, black, strained and chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces cheese, cheddar (Tillamook, sharp), grated</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Preheat oven and start heating water: Pre-heat the oven to 350°F and start to heat a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt, 2 quarts water) for cooking the egg noodles.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Make tomato sauce base: Heat 1 Tbsp of oil on medium high heat in a large, heavy bottomed pot or skillet. Add the onions and bell pepper and sauté until softened, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook for a minute more. Add the tomatoes, breaking them up with your fingers or a knife if you are using whole canned tomatoes. Bring to a simmer and let cook for 10 minutes. Lower the heat to warm.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Brown the ground beef: In a separate skillet, add 1 Tbsp of oil and heat to medium-high. Working in batches, so you do not crowd the pan, add the ground beef, breaking it up with your fingers as you add it to the pan. Do not stir the ground beef, but let it sit and cook for a minute or two until it browns on one side.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Sprinkle a little salt over the meat while cooking.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Once browned on one side, turn the pieces over to get the other side browned. Once the meat is mostly browned (can still be rare in the center), remove the beef from the pan and add to the tomato onion mixture.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Sauté the mushrooms: Add the mushrooms to the same pan that you had used for browning the beef, and sauté the mushrooms in the remaining oil and beef drippings. Once browned, add the mushrooms to the beef and tomato mixture.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Cook the egg noodles: While the mushrooms are cooking, add the egg noodle pasta to the boiling water. Cook as directed, about 4-5 minutes. Strain when cooked, but still a little firm (al dente).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Add everything to casserole dish: Add the cooked egg noodles to a large  (3 quart) casserole dish. (If your casserole dish isn't big enough, you may need to use 2 casserole dishes.) Stir in the tomato beef mixture. Stir in the corn, chopped olives, and about two thirds of the cheese.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7 Bake: Sprinkle remaining cheese on top of casserole. Place in the oven. Bake uncovered at 350°F for 30 minutes.</span><br />
