                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	The idea of making breakfast sandwiches for a crowd shook up my long-standing belief that frittata was the best party-time egg dish. The wake up call came after one of those endless internet black holes where you wonder what your search term—I landed on this recipe on a website called Shaken Together. When I made it, I lowered the temperature so the eggs retain the softness you like in a scramble but never attain in the oven, added stuff to make it a little heartier (you could add anything you like in a frittata in a 2 to 3 ratio with the eggs), and ended up eating the little squares—with and without toast—for quick breakfasts and sliced on salads. Eventually I’ll share.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 eggs</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt and freshly ground pepper</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">a little milk or cream</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup or so add ins: shaved asparagus, peas, any veg really, rendered bacon or prosciutto or pancetta, herbs</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 rolls or 12 pieces bread for toast, for serving (optional)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">cheese, melty (goat?)</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Grease a half sheet pan very well and heat the oven to 300°F. Crack all 12 eggs in a big bowl, add salt and pepper and the splash of cream, then whisk until well combined. Add the other stuff—except cheese—and gently fold until mixed.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan. Dot with cheese evenly, if using. Bake until the eggs are just set, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and cut into squares if you’re egg sandwiches. Cut however else for whatever other purpose you’re dreaming up: slivers for salad, rectangles for bigger sandwiches or to-go lunches, and so on.</span><br />
