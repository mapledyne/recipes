                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	These were unbelievably good, quite possibly my new favorite meatball recipe; they pack a lot of flavor from a few ingredients and can I say this? I hope it sounds as good to you as it does to me: They taste … cheesy. Like you’d snuck a whole lot of melty goodness in there, even though there is none. In my book, that’s a high compliment. 

These make for an excellent main course, but I will definitely be making miniature versions of them for a party, hopefully one day soon.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 slices bread, Italian, torn into small bits (1 cup)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup milk</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 ounces sliced pancetta (of swap in Canadian Bacon if you can’t find pancetta), finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 onion, small, finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 garlic clove, small, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons olive oil, extra-virgin, divided</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound chicken, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons tomato paste, divided</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons parsley, flat-leaf (Italian), fresh, finely chopped</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Preheat oven to 400°F with a rack in the upper third of the oven. Soak bread in milk in a small bowl until softened, about four minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cook pancetta, onion, and garlic in one tablespoon oil with 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper in a large skillet over medium heat until onion is softened, about 6 minutes. (Alternately, as in “I thought of this after the fact”, I’d bet you could render the pancetta for a couple minutes and cook the onions and garlic in that fat, rather than olive oil.) Cool slightly.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Squeeze bread to remove excess milk, then discard milk. Lightly beat egg in a large bowl, then combine with chicken, 1 tablespoon tomato paste, pancetta mixture, bread, and parsley. Form 12 meatballs and arrange in another 4-sided sheet pan (I used a 9×13 roasting dish).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Stir together remaining tablespoons of tomato paste and oil and brush over meatballs (the paste/oil does not mix in any cohesive manner, but just smoosh it on and run with it) , then bake in upper third of oven until meatballs are just cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes (though mine took a good 5 minutes longer).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">* I accidentally added a heaping tablespoon of the tomato paste into the meatball mixture the first time I made it, and ended up liking it better than without it. I’d use the tomato paste on top too. It’s good both places.</span><br />
