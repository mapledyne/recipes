                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1‚Äù cubes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup brown sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 tablespoons butter, unsalted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">pinch of red pepper flakes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tsp sage leaves, fresh, thinly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon thyme leaves, fresh, finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 slices bacon Nueske's brand. Cherrywood smoked, green package (exact)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 oz arugula, baby arugula preferably or large leaves torn into small pieces</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt + freshly ground black pepper</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. In a large bowl, toss the sweet potatoes with the brown sugar. Set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. In a saute pan over medium heat, cook the butter until it turns brown and nutty, about 6 minutes. Remove from the heat, and add the red pepper flakes, sage and thyme. Pour the brown butter and herbs over the sweet potatoes, making sure to get all of the brown bits. Toss well, thoroughly coating all of the sweet potatoes with the brown butter and herbs. Season with 1 tablespoon kosher salt and 1/4 tsp pepper and toss again to combine.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Transfer the sweet potatoes to a roasting pan, large enough that the potatoes are in a single layer. (A large sheet pan works well, and I like to line with parchment paper for easy clean-up). Lay the bacon strips evenly across the potatoes. Roast for 40 minutes to 1 hour, or until the sweet potatoes are tender and caramelized. After about 15 to 20 minutes, toss the potatoes with a spatula to make sure they‚Äôre coated evenly with the brown butter and herbs. Your bacon may be done at this point, depending on its thickness and how crispy you like it. If it's not, just set the bacon strips to the side, toss the potatoes, then lay them back across the potatoes for more time in the oven.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. When they're done, remove the sweet potatoes from the oven and put them into a serving bowl. Let cool for a few minutes, then toss in the arugula. You want the arugula to slightly wilt but retain some of its shape. Crumble the bacon over the sweet potatoes and toss to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</span><br />
