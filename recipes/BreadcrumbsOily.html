                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">bread, stale (that still has some give)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Carve the crust off a rustic loaf with a serrated knife and tear into 1.5 inch pieces. Grind coarsely in a food processor or blender, then toss in a bowl with plenty of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">The crumbs should be tasty and a bit oily but not soaked.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Spread on a baking sheet and bake for 7 minutes. Use a spatula to scoop the crumbs into a pile, stir them around a bit, then spread them back out. Put them back in the oven for 5 minutes and repeat with the spatula. Keep baking and stirring, until the crumbs are crisp and golden.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Use mainly for sprinkling over pasta, but also to sprinkle on chickpeas or other beans, or vegetable gratin, or shepherd's pie.</span><br />
