                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups butter, salted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 1/4 cups sugar, superfine (Bakers)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons corn syrup, light, Dissolved in 2 tablespoons warm water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">16 ounces almonds, unsalted, slivered, dry toasted (exact), toasted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces chocolate chips, Guittard brand, gold package (exact)</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Amounts doubled from recipe as shown.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Grease a large heavy saucepan and in it melt the butter over medium-low heat. As soon as it's melted, stir in the sugar. Continue to stir constantly until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture comes to a rolling boil. Add the corn syrup-water mixture and stir well; the mixture will hiss and spit for a few seconds, but that's alright.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">With the pan still on the heat, cover the saucepan and leave it covered for 3 minutes. Then uncover it and stick the candy thermometer. Keeping the heat at medium low, and stirring once in a while, heat the mixture to 300 degrees F. At some point before it reaches that temperature, scatter half the toasted almonds evenly over the bottom of a baking sheet.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">When the candy reaches 300 degrees, remove it from the heat immediately and pour it inot the almond pan, tilting the pan back and forth to cover it evenly (Wear overn mitts, the pan gets incredibly hot). Do not scrape the saucepan, or the candy might crystallize. Let cool.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">When the candy is cool, heat the semisweet chocolate in the top of a double boiler until it's about two-thirds melted. Take the chocolate off the heat and stir until the remaining chocolate is melted as well.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Pour the chocolate onto the cooled candy and spread it over the candy's entire surface with a rubber spatula. Sprinkle the rest of the almonds over the chocolate.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cool the candy until the chocolate is set, about 2 hours or longer. Turn the pan upside down on a surface covered with wax paper. Rap the bottom of the pan until the sheet of buttercrunch comes out. Then break into bite sized pieces.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Buttercrunch keeps well and freezes well. Make sure to put it in plastic bags if putting it in cardboard boxes otherwise grease stains will gradually make their way to the surface of the boxes, which wouldn't be very Christmas-y.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Makes about 2 pounds.</span><br />
