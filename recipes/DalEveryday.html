                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	We’ve since made this dish many many times in our house. It’s one of those rare recipes that everyone in the family applauds, it easy to throw together and even easier on the wallet – and this time of year that is such a bonus. 

This recipe comes directly from my friend, Tara, and her stunning book, Seven Spoons. I’ve kept the recipe in her words because she writes so beautifully. Her entire book is a stunner – add it to your wish list if you don’t already have it. 

As I mentioned in the post I made a few tweaks here and there based on what was available in my pantry (I used butter, red onion, and parsley) so you can trust that this recipe will serve you well even if it’s not followed perfectly.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup yellow lentils, split (moong dal)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cups (710 ml) water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon turmeric, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt, kosher</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons ghee or unsalted butter</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon cumin seeds</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 onion, small, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 or 2 red chiles, fresh or dried whole</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">A small bunch cilantro, Leaves picked from</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Lime wedges for serving</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">rice, cooked</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">To make the dal, in a medium heavy saucepan, cover the dal with water. Swish the lentils around with your hand, then drain the water through a fine-mesh sieve. Return any dal from the sieve to the saucepan and repeat, washing, agitating, and draining, until the water runs absolutely clear. It will probably take 7 to 10 changes of water. Pour the 3 cups (710 ml) of water into the pot to cover the lentils. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, skim any scum that rises to the surface, then lower the heat to maintain a simmer. Add the turmeric and cook until the dal is quite creamy, 45 to 60 minutes. Stir the dal regularly as it simmers or it can catch at the bottom of the pan and burn. If the dal starts to look dry before the lentils are cooked, add hot water (from the tap is fine). Season well with salt.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">About 20 minutes before the dal is done, make the tarka. Melt the ghee over low heat. Fry the cumin seeds for maybe 1 minute, until sizzling and fragrant. Add the onion and chile and cook, stirring, until the onion is very soft and translucent, 15 minutes. When the dal is ready, tip the tarka over the dal, stir to partially combine, then sprinkle the cilantro on top. Serve right away with lime wedges and naan or over rice.</span><br />
