	Sometimes you just need an amazingly easy, delicious meal to get you through the week. This is a perfect leftover meal - you can use whatever greens you have lying around and day or two old bread makes the best breadcrumbs. It took me about 30 minutes in total (including making the breadcrumbs!) and really spiced up the regular old pasta and tomato sauce routine. - Hotplate Gourmet (less) —Hotplate Gourmet

Food52 Review: Hotplate Gourmet made her ambitions very clear -- this linguini dish is to be a respectable weeknight dinner, something easy but good. Well, it's more than that -- we think it's terrific. Like an old Italian nonna, Hotplate Gourmet has you use the pasta water to help cook the kale and has you add breadcrumbs to the kale to fortify the pasta. You saute the breadcrumbs in oil, then add garlic and kale, and not too much of either. The garlic gently scents the kale and the greens add substance and sweetness, without making you feeling like you're eating kale for the sake of eating kale! You pull the dish together with some fresh olive oil and grated parmesan and you have a wonderful fall dinner. Next time we make this, we'll set aside the breadcrumbs after they've been toasted and add them back to the pan once the kale has been cooked. Their crunch is so great, you don't want to risk having them get soggy!
