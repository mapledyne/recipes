                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 pound pasta, of your choice (such as a ziti or twisty shape)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon olive oil, extra-virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 pounds mushroom, cremini sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 small - medium onion, yellow, halved and sliced thin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup wine, dry marsala</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons butter, unsalted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups broth, chicken, vegetable or mushroom)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup cheese, parmesan, finely grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 ounces cheese, mozzarella, cut into small cubes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons parsley, flat-leaf, chopped</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">A tip: If we play our cards right here, this can be made entirely in one dish. I used a 4-quart Staub braiser but any 3-to-4 quart stovetop-to-oven type dish will work.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Another tip: Double it and use a 9 x 13 dish to serve a crowd.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cook the pasta: Bring a pot of well-salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente, about 1 to 2 minutes before perfect doneness. Drain and set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat oven: To 400 degrees.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Make the sauce: Reheat your empty pasta pot over high heat. Add oil and once it is hot, add mushrooms and cook until they’ve begun to brown and glisten, but have not yet released their liquid. Reduce heat to medium-high, add onions, salt and pepper and saute together until the liquid the mushrooms give off is evaporated. Add Marsala and cook mixture, stirring, until it has almost or fully evaporated (depending on your preference). Add butter, stir until melted. Add flour, and stir until all has been dampened and absorbed. Add stock, a very small splash at a time, stirring the whole time with a spoon. Make sure each splash has been fully mixed into the butter/flour/mushroom mixture, scraping from the bottom of the pan and all around, before adding the next splash. Repeat until all stock has been added. Let mixture simmer together for 2 minutes, stirring frequently; the sauce will thicken. Remove pan from heat.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Assemble and bake dish: If you’re cooking in an ovensafe dish, add cooked pasta and stir until combined. (If you’re not cooking in an ovensafe dish, transfer this mixture to a 2-quart baking dish.) Stir in half the parmesan, all of the mozzarella and two tablespoons of the parsley until evenly mixed. Sprinkle the top with remaining parmesan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until edges of pasta are golden brown and irresistible. Sprinkle with reserved parsley and serve hot. Reheat as needed.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">A bunch of notes:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">•Why marsala? Because it’s the Pantone Color of the Year 2015! More seriously, Marsala is a fortified wine from Sicily with a deep, complex flavor. It comes in dry and sweet versions; for savory dishes, use the dry. (For zabaglione, use the sweet. And invite me over.) It shares some commonalities with Sherry and Madeira, which aren’t exactly substitutes, but would also taste good here. You can buy dry Marsala it at wine shops inexpensively. I find that mine keeps open in the fridge for a year, but I have a feeling wine experts are grimacing. Seriously, though, ours still tastes for cooking great very long after it’s been opened and that’s all I need to know.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">•We don’t consume or cook with alcohol: Here’s what I’m not going to say, “But the alcohol cooks off!” as most recipes will tell you because it, yes, it largely/mostly does, but not completely. Since I’m cooking for a mixed-age family, I cook mine down to nonexistence (I’m after the flavor, not a nap, though naps = swoon, you know?) but I know that many people will not want to use it at all. And you don’t have to. This dish will still be incredibly delicious without it. If you’re looking to try something clever/delicious in a different way, you might rehydrate a few dried porcinis in 1/4 cup boiling water. Remove them, chop them find and add them to the other mushrooms for a louder mushroom flavor. Then, strain the porcini soaking liquid to remove any sand/grit, add 1 teaspoon sherry or red wine vinegar and use this instead of the Marsala for a little extra flavor oomph.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">•If it weren’t me making this: You might add some diced cooked chicken to the final baking portion. I personally am incredibly put off by chicken in pasta dishes, but seriously this is no time to start opening the terrifying large can of Implausible Things Deb Doesn’t Like.</span><br />
