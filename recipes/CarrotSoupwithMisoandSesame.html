                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	Usually, recipe writers urge you to season food throughout, building layers of flavor. Here, don’t. The miso we add at the end is very salty and it’s safest to decide how much seasoning your soup needs after that. 

Note: This soup is “gluten-free” with a large caveat, and that is that most miso is in part from barley and is not gluten-free. You will need to seek out a miso brand — such as this shiro miso from Eden — that is clearly marked as such for it to be good to go.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 pounds carrots, peeled, thinly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 large onion, finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 - 6 cloves garlic cloves, peeled and smashed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon ginger, finely chopped or grated, or more to taste (it could easily be doubled)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup miso paste, white, or more to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 cups vegetable broth</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Drizzle of toasted sesame oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 scallions, very thinly sliced</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add carrots, onion and garlic sauté until onion is translucent, about 10 minutes. Add broth and ginger. Cover and simmer until carrots are tender when pierced, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Puree soup in batches in blender, or all at once with an immersion blender. In a small bowl, whisk together the miso an a half-cup of the soup. Stir the mixture back into the pot of soup. Taste the soup and season with salt, pepper or additional miso to taste.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Ladle into bowls and garnish each with a drizzle of sesame oil and small mound of scallions.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Pickled scallions? I didn’t do this in the end, but was tempted to lightly pickled the scallions by letting them hang out in a mixture of 6 tablespoons rice vinegar, 2 tablespoons water, 1 tablespoon of Kosher salt (I use Diamond brand, use less if you’re using Morton or another, which are more dense) and 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar for a while before using them as garnish.</span><br />
