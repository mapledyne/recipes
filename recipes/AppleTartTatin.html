                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 medium apples, tart (such as Crimson Crisp or Granny Smith)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 lemon, juice of</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 tablespoons butter, unsalted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 (14-ounce) box frozen puff pastry; thawed but kept chilled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup whipped cream, sour cream or lightly sweetened</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Peel and core the apples whole, then halve them crosswise to create doughnut-shaped rounds. In a bowl, toss the apple halves gently with the lemon juice and 1/4 cup of the sugar. Set aside for 30 minutes in the fridge.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Preheat the oven to 400°F.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a 12-inch ovenproof skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Sprinkle in the remaining 3/4 cup sugar and swirl it in the pan until it becomes a golden brown caramel, slightly chunky with granules of unmelted sugar, then remove from the heat. Lay the apples in the skillet, arranging 6 rounds on the perimeter and one in the center. Cut the remaining 3 apple rounds into 1/2-inch pieces and slide them in between the halves to make it a tight configuration.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Return the pan to the stovetop over medium heat and cook the apples in the caramel for 8 to 10 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Roll out your puff pastry to a 13- to 14-inch piece and trim it to a circle. Remove the skillet from the heat and lay the pastry round over the apples. The caramel will be extremely hot, so do not touch it with bare fingers, but use a spatula to tuck the edges of the pastry around the apples toward the bottom of the pan, to create a lip on the final tart. At this point, it does not need to look perfect, and if the pastry does not fit exactly, do not fret—just make sure that you can patch together a full cover for the apples and that the pastry (pastry quilt, if you will) goes to the edges of the apples and down over that outer edge.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bake until the pastry is puffed and golden brown, about 20 minutes—darker is better than lighter.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove from the oven and let stand for 2 minutes. Place a plate at least 14 inches around over the pan, serving side toward the apples, and quickly and smoothly flip the pan and the plate upside down together to allow the tart to end up on the plate with the pan on top of it. Shake the pan gently to make sure the apples and the pastry have detached from the pan, and carefully lift the pan away. If there are rogue pieces of apple stuck to the pan, gently move them off of the pan and place them in their spot on the pastry crust.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Serve with a dollop of whipped cream and eat immediately.</span><br />
