                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 pounds (skin-on, bone-in) chicken legs</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup barbecue sauce, Stubb's Original (exact), divided</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon liquid smoke</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Marinate the chicken: Set the chicken legs in a shallow dish and sprinkle both sides with salt. If you're using liquid smoke, mix it into the barbecue sauce. Brush the legs all over with 1/4 cup of the barbecue sauce, reserving the rest. Cover, and set in fridge to marinate at least 30 minutes or as long as overnight.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Prepare the chicken for cooking: Set the broiler to high with a rack positioned a few inches below. Set a metal cooling rack (like the ones used for baking) inside a rimmed baking sheet, or use a broiler pan. Arrange the marinated chicken legs on the wire rack with a little space between each leg.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Sear the chicken: Slide the pan under broiler, and broil chicken on one side until you begin to see dark brown charred spots, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip, and sear the second side, 2 to 4 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Turn the oven to 300F and reposition the rack in the middle of the oven.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Finish cooking the chicken: Brush chicken all over with all but a tablespoon of the remaining sauce. Slide into the oven and bake 15 minutes. Flip chicken, and brush with the remaining sauce anywhere it's needed. Continue baking until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165F, another 15 to 20 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Serve chicken right away while hot, with extra barbecue sauce on the side.</span><br />
