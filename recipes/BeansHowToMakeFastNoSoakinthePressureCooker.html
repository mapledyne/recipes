                <span itemprop="description">
	Add a tablespoon of oil: This helps reduce foaming as the beans cook, which can sometimes clog up the pressure valve and interfere with cooking.

Add a teaspoon or two of salt: This is your only opportunity to season the beans on the inside, so be sure to add some salt to the pot. Start with one teaspoon with your first batch and see how you like the flavor. I usually add two teaspoons to my beans.

Add flavoring ingredients! Flavorful add-ins like garlic, onions, and bay leaves make beans even tastier. Add them at the start of cooking along with the oil and salt.

Always use enough liquid to cover your beans by a few inches: Beans absorb a lot of liquid during cooking. For one pound of beans, eight cups of water is usually plenty. You can experiment with reducing the amount of liquid, if you like, but be careful of reducing it too much or your beans won’t cook properly.

Don’t fill the pot more than halfway full with liquid: This is a precaution against overflow due to foaming during cooking.

Adjust the cooking time as needed: Think of the cooking times I give below as a starting point, then adjust the time in subsequent batches to suit your particular taste. Try the lower end of the time range if you want firm beans for things like salads and tacos, or cook for more time if you want softer beans for things like hummus, refried beans, or soup.

Also, consult the manual that came with your pressure cooker. The times I give below are based on my testing with an Instant Pot (which I found to be consistent with the cooking times recommended in the Instant Pot manual); cooking times may be slightly different for your particular model.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound beans, dried</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 cups water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoons salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 or 3 cloves garlic, peeled, optional</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 bay leaf, optional</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Combine all ingredients in the pressure cooker. Do not fill the pressure cooker more than half full.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2 Secure the lid. Make sure the pressure regulator valve is closed. (On an Instant Pot, this means it will be set to the the "sealing" position.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3 Cook the beans: Here are the cooking times for unsoaked beans in the Instant Pot. Cooking times will be similar for other electric pressure cookers; cooking time will be slightly less for stovetop pressure cookers. Double-check the manual that came with your pressure cooker for more exact cooking times:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Black beans: 20 to 25 minutes Black-eyed peas : 20 to 25 minutes Great Northern beans: 25 to 30 minutes Navy beans: 25 to 30 minutes Pinto beans: 25 to 30 minutes Cannellini beans: 35 to 40 minutes Chickpeas (garbanzo beans): 35 to 40 minutes</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cook beans at high pressure for the time recommended above. The pressure cooker will take 15 to 20 minutes to come to full pressure before cooking begins.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4 Let the pressure release: Once cooking is complete, you can let the pressure release naturally on its own, which takes about 20 to 30 minutes, or you can do a "rapid release" by opening the pressure valve on the top of the pressure cooker. If doing a rapid release, protect your hands from the steam with oven mitts or use a long-handled spoon to manipulate the pressure valve.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">I recommend letting the pressure release naturally for as long as you're able before the beans are needed. This helps the beans retain their shape.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5 Using and storing your beans: The beans are ready to use right away. Let leftover beans cool in their cooking liquid, then refrigerate in a covered container for up to a week or freeze for up to 3 months.</span><br />
