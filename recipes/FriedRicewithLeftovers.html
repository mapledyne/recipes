                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	This stir-fried rice isn't based on authentic Asian recipes—although those that I have followed in the past all share the same spirit of improvisation. Rather, this is what I have come to rely on in my own home kitchen when I want a delicious dinner with very little effort. 

At least once—and sometimes twice—a week, it's my tried-and-true, easy-peasy, deeply satisfying, super quick dinner. If you have leftover rice (brown or white) in the fridge, along with some roast chicken or a few slices of last night’s steak or fish dinner, this dish can be made swiftly and easily. Get everything prepped and laid out on the counter next to the stove and it’ll come together in as quickly as 15 minutes. 

But even if you do have to cook the rice first (this is why I love my rice cooker) and/or sauté a raw protein, the meal is still a relatively painless.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup oil, such as sesame or peanut, divided</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 shallot, large, peeled and sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 clove garlic, peeled and smashed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups rice, cooked (leftover from takeout is awesome), ideally jasmine</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 pound (more or less) protein</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 chile, small fresh, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon ginger, freshly grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups greens, such as slivered napa cabbage, halved baby bok choy, or roughly cut spinach</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon soy sauce</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon sherry vinegar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 lime, juiced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 bunch cilantro, picked into leaves</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 scallion, sliced on the bias (optional)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup peanuts, toasted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted white</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. In a wok or large cast-iron pan, heat the oil over high heat.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Add the shallots and garlic and let color on one side. Flip over, then add the rice. Pour in 2 to 3 tablespoons of water to steam up and reheat the rice. Let the rice cook uncovered so that it crisps up on the bottom. When warmed and browned, remove from the pan and reserve.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Add 2 more tablespoons vegetable oil to the pan and fry the chile, if using, and ginger. Then add the greens and whatever leftover protein you have and heat. Season with a little salt.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. When cooked, add the rice back in and toss everything around together. Transfer to a bowl and pour the soy sauce, vinegar, and lime juice and mix to combine. Add in cilantro and, if using, scallions and peanuts. Sprinkle sesame seeds over the top. Eat.</span><br />
