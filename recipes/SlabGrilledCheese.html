                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	You're just one sheet pan, one piece of focaccia, and a whole lotta cheese away from this slab grilled cheese. We used cheddar because we like it's melt, but you can use other comparable cheeses. You can also make Saltie's Focaccia for this, or go store-bought in a pinch. One of the best things about this party showstopper is that you don't even need butter or oil to get it going—the focaccia provides the good stuff.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 large piece bread, focaccia, one that will fit snugly on an 18 x13-inch baking sheet</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 pounds cheese, Cheddar, or comparable</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">(optional) Crumbled bacon, pesto, sun-dried tomatoes, or anything you'd put in a regular grilled cheese</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Preheat your oven to 375°F. Slice the focaccia so that you have two equal slabs.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Sprinkle your preferred grated cheese for as little or as much coverage as you'd like between the slices of focaccia.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Weigh the whole thing down with a heavy-bottomed pan—that's right, put a pan right on top of the focaccia—and bake at 375°F for about 8 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Slice into 9 large sandwiches, or as small as you'd like to serve at a party.</span><br />
