	Author Notes: This recipe is very easily doubled. Don't fret too much about getting the measurements perfect, either; this is the kind of recipe that begs for a bit of this, a dash of that. 

Serve it as a side with dinner, on a sandwich, or underneath a fat ball of burrata.  (less) —Kenzi Wilbur

Food52 Review: WHO: Kenzi Wilbur is our fearless Managing Editor and our expert on all things cocktails and mayonnaise. 
WHAT: A way to make shallots into an elegant side, just in time for Thanksgiving dinner. 
HOW: Roast halved shallots in a hot oven with olive oil and brown sugar until they’ve developed a nice crust. Take the pan off the heat and quench the shallots in sherry and balsamic vinegar. Shake the shallots around and return them to the oven, covered, until they’re tender. 
WHY WE LOVE IT: On the day before a big holiday meal, you’re scrambling to make sure you’ll have enough food to feed the masses. But don’t add just another vegetable side. With minimal chopping, a pound of shallots, pantry ingredients, and a hot oven, you can have crisp, slightly sweet shallots that will complement anything else you’re serving.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound shallots, peeled, the larger ones halved</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons sugar, brown</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">A three-finger pinch salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon thyme, fresh, finely chopped plus a few whole sprigs</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons sherry</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons vinegar, balsamic</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Heat oven to 400° F.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Put olive oil in an ovenproof skillet. (Alternatively, you can brown the shallots in whatever pan you like, and then transfer them into a baking dish).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Add the brown sugar, mix to just combine, then add shallots, cut-side down if you've halved any. Brown over medium heat for 10 minutes, flipping once halfway through, or as soon as a beautiful brown crust has developed on the first side.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Take the pan off of the heat, and add everything else -- salt, thyme, sherry, vinegar -- shake the pan a bit, and then cover with foil and roast in the oven until completely cooked through. Depending on the size of your shallots, this can take anywhere from 25 to 40 minutes -- test with a knife every 5 minutes beginning at the 25-minute mark.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Serve warm.</span><br />
