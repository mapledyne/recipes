                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	Our favorite way of preparing angel hair nests is a Mexican dish called “sopa seca de fideo”. It’s a lot like pilaf, but made with thin noodles instead of rice.

The name “sopa seca de fideo” translates to “dry soup with noodles”. It’s not soup, it’s called a “dry soup” because the noodles absorb all of the wonderful rich stock, making the noodles taste more delicious than you can possibly imagine. 

The dish is made with thin noodles, angel hair pasta or vermicelli. My mother makes this dish at least once a month and we were raised just calling it by the noodle name, vermicelli. All you have to do is say that word and the collective eyes of our family light up with glee.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 lb angel hair nests or vemicelli. Vermicelli usually comes in 1 lb packages, so about 1/2 a package</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup olive or canola oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 onion, yellow, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup tomatoes, crushed canned, or 2 fresh tomatoes, peeled and chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups chicken broth</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt and pepper</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1 Choose a frying pan with a lid in which the angel hair nests will all tightly fit in a single layer (about 9 or 10-inches wide, depending on the brand of angel hair nests you use). In the pan, fry the vermicelli on both sides in hot oil until golden brown in color. Remove from pan.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2 In the same oil, brown the minced onion, add the chopped tomato. Add chicken broth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3 Bring the broth mixture to a simmer. When broth is simmering, place the angel hair nests in a single layer in the pan, nestled into the broth. The nests should cover the whole pan. Turn them over in the broth so that they get moistened on all sides. Cover and cook until the vermicelli has soaked up the liquid, about 5 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">If after 5 minutes the top of the vermicelli is dry, flip over the individual angel hair nests and cook a minute longer. Remove from heat and let sit for 5 minutes before serving.</span><br />
