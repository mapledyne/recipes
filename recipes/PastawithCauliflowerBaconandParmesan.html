                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 to 4 ounces bacon, Nueske's brand. Cherrywood smoked, green package (exact), cut into half inch pieces</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">olive oil, extra-virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup bread crumbs, panko</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 Tbsp parsley, fresh, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon thyme, fresh (or 1/2 teaspoon dried)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups onion, red, thinly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 Tbsp garlic, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 cups cauliflower florets, small bite-sized</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 pound pasta, cavatappi, gemelli or fusilli, or fusilli dry pasta</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons lemon zest, grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup cheese, parmesan, grated</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1 Place a large pot of salted water (2 quarts of water, 1 Tbsp salt), on to the stove to boil. While the water is heating, continue with the recipe.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2 Place the bacon pieces in a large sauté pan on medium heat. Cook until lightly browned and much of the fat rendered, about 5-6 minutes. Remove the bacon from the pan to a bowl, retaining the fat in the pan.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3 While the bacon in step 2 is rendering, brown the panko in a separate skillet on medium high heat, stirring occasionally. When most of the panko is browned, remove from heat and place in a bowl. Stir in 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 3/4 teaspoon salt, 1/8 teaspoon of pepper, the parsley and thyme. Set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4 Increase the heat to medium high. You'll want about a tablespoon to a tablespoon and a half of fat in the pan. If your bacon has not yielded that much fat, then add some olive oil to the pan. Add the sliced red onion. Cook until lightly browned, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook an minute more. Remove the onions and garlic from the pan, adding them to the bowl with the bacon.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5 Add 2 more tablespoons of olive oil to the pan and heat on high heat. Add the cauliflower florets and toss to coat with the olive oil. Brown on high heat for 5 minutes, and then lower the heat, cover, and cook for 5 more minutes, or until the cauliflower florets are cooked through and tender.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6 About the same time that you start cooking the cauliflower, add the pasta to the boiling pasta water. Cook the pasta at a rolling boil for 8 to 10 minutes, until cooked through, but still a little firm to the bite, al dente. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta water and drain the pasta.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7 Add the bacon and onions into the pan with the cauliflower. Stir in the pasta, lemon zest, grated Parmesan. Drizzle in another tablespoon of olive oil. Sprinkle with some of the reserved pasta water to loosen the pasta and cauliflower if it seems a bit dry. Serve topped with toasted seasoned breadcrumbs.</span><br />
