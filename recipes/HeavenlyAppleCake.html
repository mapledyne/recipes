                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	Though not even approaching being eligible for a beauty contest, this cake seems to be irresistible. It stays fresh and gooey for days (that is if there's any left) and it's really very simple. The recipe originated in a community cookbook that I used regularly for years. The cake was always delicious but, over the years I've changed things--NO nuts--raisins--raisins soaked in Rum--but now I've settled on adding dates soaked in Apple Brandy (or Calvados if you're feeling flush!) Sometimes I substitute brown sugar for half the white sugar. As I say, NOT pretty, but well worth it.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 to 3/4 cups raisins</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 to 3/4 cups brandy, apple</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups unbleached, all purpose flour</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup sugar, white</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup sugar, brown</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons baking soda</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon cinnamon, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 teaspoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 cups apples, slightly tart, peeled, cored and roughly chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup butter, sweet, melted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 eggs, lightly beaten</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Icing sugar for decoration, (optional)</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. About one hour before starting to bake (or the night before), place the raisins in a small bowl and cover with the apple brandy (or Calvados). Stir from time to time and if they get too "tight", just add more brandy!</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Preheat oven to 325. Using butter, grease a baking pan (approximately 13 x 9 x 2)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Into a large bowl sift together flour, sugars, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Add the chopped apples, raisins, melted butter and the eggs. This will be a very heavy, thick batter but don't worry -- just be sure to mix it well.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Spread in the prepared pan, place on a rack in center of the oven and bake for 1 hour. Test with a skewer -- if it comes out still a bit gooey, bake for another 5 to 10 minutes. You'll know when it's done. It will be a nice dark tan color and will spring back to a light touch.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Remove from oven, let cool a bit. This is delicious hot, warm or cold. As I mentioned, this cake isn't a beauty queen so should be plated in the kitchen! I sprinkle each serving with icing sugar.</span><br />
