	Author Notes: Inspired by the daily lunch menu of my favorite restaurant, this dish is special because it’s quick and comforting. The cider melds in with the mushrooms and garbanzos to make a sweet, slightly savory gravy. I used hard cider and splurged on fancy shiitake mushrooms from our local mushroomery. A cider-juice and any type of mushroom will work, though the nicer ones will result in a richer flavor. Choose a thick, rustic-type bread to hold up to the mushrooms and garbanzos.

Food52 Review: Maybe it's because of the long military influence in my life, but I love savory sauces served over bread or toast. I had not, however, had any sauce or gravy with an apple cider base and had no clue what it would taste like. It was a tasty surprise! I can't believe that I was actually nervous pouring the cider in! 
I followed the instructions exactly, but used baby portobellas instead of shiitake mushrooms and in no time had a brunch that included my favorite legume - garbanzos. The instructions and measurements were spot on. 
My boyfriend and I loved the combination. The portobellas had a texture well matched to the garbanzos, the cider flavor was enhanced by reducing and added seasonings. I have enough ingredients to make another batch and my one tweak will be to add some crisped up pancetta for an added layer of flavor. I'm definitely going to be making this for weekend guests. Bravo Rebecca!!
