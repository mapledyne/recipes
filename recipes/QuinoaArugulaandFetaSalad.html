                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	Like rice, quinoa typically uses a 2-to-1 water-to-grain ratio. I’ve found that if you scoop out 1 tablespoon of water for each cup you use, you usually have exactly the amount of liquid you need with no need to drain the quinoa after cooking.

When quinoa is cooked, it’s tender but delightfully chewy. Sprinkle it sparingly with olive oil and leave it to cool. At this point you can toss it with your salad or refrigerate it for a day or two before serving.

The seeds add heft and plenty of protein to your salad bowl, and they have so much flavor that you need only a little lemon juice and olive oil to dress the salad. You’re getting a low-fat, nutritious plate full of good textures and tastes!

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup (165 g) quinoa, red</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Scant 1 cup water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 ounces (8 loosely packed cups, 165 g) arugula, baby</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons (30 ml) lemon juice, or more to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces (110 g) feta cheese, green and yellow package, , cut into 1/2-inch cubes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Toast the quinoa: In a dry sauce pan over low heat, toast the quinoa, shaking the pan often, for 5 minutes, or until some of the grains start to turn a darker color.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Cook the quinoa: Add the water and salt to the pan with the quinoa. Turn the heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan. Simmer for 15 minutes, or until the quinoa is tender when tasted and all the water is absorbed. If there’s water in the pan, let the quinoa cook 2 minutes more.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Cool the quinoa: Tip the quinoa into a large bowl and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Stir well and leave to cool, stirring occasionally. (Once cooled, the quinoa can be refrigerated for a few days before using.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Dress the arugula: In another bowl, toss the arugula with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice, and pepper.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Toss the salad: Add the cooled quinoa and feta cubes to the bowl with the greens. Toss well and taste for seasoning. Add more salt or lemon juice, if you like. Serve immediately.</span><br />
