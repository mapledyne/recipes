                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces shrimp, raw, about 18 pieces</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon paprika</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/8 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons butter</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup shallots, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 Tbsp garlic, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cup arborio rice</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup white wine, dry</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces clam juice</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 14-ounce can artichoke hearts, packed in water, drained and finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 Tbsp parsley, fresh, chopped (optional)</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Pat dry the peeled and deveined shrimp and place them in a medium bowl, toss to coat with 1/2 teaspoon salt, the paprika, and pepper.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Heat 1 Tbsp butter in a small saute pan on high heat. Add the shrimp and saute for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, until just barely cooked through. Then remove to a bowl and set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Put 3 cups of water with about a teaspoon of salt in a small saucepan. Heat until simmering and keep warm while you start the risotto.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Heat 2 Tbsp butter in a 3 to 4-quart thick-bottomed pot on medium heat. Add the minced shallots and cook until translucent, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook a minute more.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Add the risotto rice to the pot, stir to coat. Add 1/2 cup dry white wine. Let come to a low simmer and slowly stir until the wine has been absorbed by the rice.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Add the clam juice and the reserved water from the can of artichokes, a half cup at a time, slowly stirring and allowing the rice to absorb the liquid before adding more liquid.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Once the rice as absorbed the wine, clam juice, and artichoke water, you can start adding the hot, lightly salted water from step one. Add it 1/2 cup at a time, again stirring slowly allowing the rice to absorb it before adding any more. You'll need between 2 and 3 cups of water. You'll want to stop adding water when the rice is cooked through, but still a little firm to the bite, "al dente".</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">8. Stir in the chopped artichoke hearts. Fold in the shrimp and chopped parsley. Serve immediately.</span><br />
