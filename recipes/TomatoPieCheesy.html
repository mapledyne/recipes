                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	This is a riff on the traditional Southern tomato pie - but it's not-so traditional! My version, made in partnership with Real California Milk, starts with an all butter pie crust with the addition of a healthy amount of cheese. Heirloom tomatoes, onions, and garlic are layered inside, then the whole thing is finished with a layer of mascarpone, eggs, and shredded cheese - some of this creamy mixture melts into the filling, the rest becomes golden and crusty on the surface.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 3/4 cups (7 1/2 ounces) flour, all purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups (9 ounces) cheese, finely grated dry Jack, divided</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon (1 gram) salt, kosher</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 cup (6 ounces) butter, unsalted, cut into 1/2 inch cubes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup (2 ounces) water, ice, plus more as needed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg whites, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 large tomatoes, heirloom, thickly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt, as needed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons butter, unsalted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 onion, sweet, thinly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cloves garlic, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (8 ounces) cheese, mascarpone</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (6 ounces) cheese, mozarella, grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 large egg</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 large egg yolks</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Make the pie dough: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt to combine. Add the butter, tossing the cubes in the flour to coat. Rub the butter into the flour until it is the size of walnut halves. Add 1 cup of the Jack cheese and stir into the dough.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Make a well in the center, and add the water a few tablespoons at a time and mix just until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a 1 inch thick disc, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate until well chilled (at least 30 minutes).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/4-inch thick. Transfer it to the springform and trim the edge so there is 1/2-inch overhang all around. Chill the dough inside pan for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator. Preheat the oven to 425° F. Lightly grease a 9-inch springform pan and place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Dock the chilled dough with a fork on the base and sides. Line the crust with parchment paper and pie weights, and bake until the crust is beginning to brown at the edges, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the parchment and pie weights. If the base looks visibly wet or under-baked, return the crust to the oven without the pie weights for another 5 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Brush the base of the pie dough with egg white and sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup Jack cheese on top. Return to the oven for 2 more minutes. Use scissors to cut the excess crust so it's flush to the edge, then cool the crust to room temperature.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. While the pie is cooling, make the filling: Arrange the tomatoes on a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Sprinkle each tomato slice lightly with salt, then place more paper towels on top. Let sit for 10 to 15 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. In a medium pan, heat the butter over medium heat. Add the onions and saute until translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté until fragrant, 1 minute more. Season with salt and pepper. Cool to room temperature.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">8. In a medium bowl, whisk the mascarpone, mozzarella, egg, and egg yolk to combine. Refrigerate until ready to use.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">9. When you're ready to assemble the pie, place the par-baked crust on your work surface. Place a layer of tomatoes in the base, then top with a layer of onions. Continue layering, ending with tomatoes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">10. Pour the mascarpone mixture into the center of the pie, and spread into an even layer - nearly to the edges. Bake until the crust is golden brown, the tomatoes are bubbly, and the topping is golden. Let cool at least 30 minutes before slicing and serving. (The pie is best when you let it cool COMPLETELY - you can reheat individual slices on a baking sheet, wrapped in aluminum foil at 325°F for 10 minutes.)</span><br />
