                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	This is my go-to sandwich bread and I find that a stash of it in the freezer makes even the most sad desk sandwich something to look forward to. The dough is quite forgiving; use more water if you want to skip the milk, or use a soy milk. Use more sugar or salt, use less. Forget what you’re doing and it will forgive you if it rises a little too long. Accidentally leave it in the fridge for the better part of a week and it will taste even better than if you’d baked it on the first day, growing more flavorful with age.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 cups flour, whole-wheat</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups rolled oats, (I used quick-cooking for the least noticeable texture)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon salt, kosher or coarse</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons sugar, raw or brown, honey or agave nectar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup vegetable or olive oil, plus a little more to coat bowl</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/4 cups water, lukewarm</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/4 cups milk, any kind, lukewarm</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 tablespoons instant yeast</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Make bread dough: In the bottom of large mixing bowl, combine water, milk and sugar or honey, then stir in yeast. Add egg and oil and whisk until combined. Add flour, oats and salt and if mixing with a machine, combine with paddle attachment at the lowest speed for 1 minute. If mixing by hand, use a large spoon and stir for 1 minute. The dough will be wet and coarse; do not fret. Let it rest for 5 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">If using a mixer, switch to the dough hook and mix the dough on medium-low for 2 more minutes. By hand, do the same with your spoon. The dough will seem firm and more smooth, ideally supple and sticky, but if it’s still very wet, add a bit more flour, a spoonful at a time. If it seems excessively stiff, add a little more water, a spoonful at a time. Continue to mix with dough hook or by hand for 4 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Scrape dough out onto lightly floured counter. Knead a few times, then form the dough into a ball. Oil your empty mixing bowl and return dough to it. Cover with plastic wrap and let proof at room temperature for 60 to 70 minutes, or until doubled in buik or transfer to the fridge and let it ferment overnight or up to 5 days. If proofing in the fridge, remove the dough before the fridge about 3 hours before you plan to bake it.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Form loaves: Turn dough onto a floured counter and divide it into two equal pieces. Press each gently into a rough rectangle-ish shape. Fold in sides so that the first dough is roughly the width of your bread loaf pan (about 9 inches). Roll from bottom to top and then put this log into your bread loaf pan, seam side down. Repeat with remaining dough. Let proof at room temperature for about an hour, or until the dough has crowned 1 inch above the rim of the baking pan. Halfway through, heat oven to 350 degrees F.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bake bread: For 35 to 40 minutes, rotating pans once for even color. A cooked loaf of bread will sound a bit hollow when tapped and the internal temperature should read 190 degrees F. Remove loaves from tins and let cool on a rack. If you’re planning to freeze bread, I like to let it cool completely before slicing it, then sliding the sliced loaf into freezer bags. You can mark them with a date, but they rarely last long enough to be forgotten.</span><br />
