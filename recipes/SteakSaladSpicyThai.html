	Author Notes: If you love Thai food as much as I do, you know it packs a punch of flavor. This salad won't disappoint: seared steak gets bathed in a fragrant dressing of fresh lime juice, robust fish sauce, fiery chilies, and garlic. It is then tossed together with crunchy sliced onions, chives, and cilantro -- get ready for a party in your mouth. I like to serve this with some steamed basmati rice to soak up all the delicious vinaigrette. (less) â€”Merav

Food52 Review: Everyone loves Thai food, right? But it's so hard to reproduce those authentic flavors in your home kitchen. This recipe delivers that delicious flavor with a few simple (and easy to find in the grocery store) ingredients. The spiciness was spot on; hot enough without singeing your taste buds. Although I could have done with a lower onion-to-beef ratio, the combination of the herbs and onions with the lime and fish flavors was just fantastic. Served on steamed rice, it was great. Served as a filler for lettuce wraps, it was mind-blowing. Possibly the best part: It seemed to get even better when I ate the leftovers the next day.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound steak (flank top sirloin)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 - 2 chilies, fresh red</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cloves garlic, fresh, peeled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 tablespoons fish sauce</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 tablespoons lime juice, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 onions, medium, thinly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 packet chives, sliced into 1-inch lengths</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 handful cilantro, roughly chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">rice, cooked, to serve</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. In a pan or on the grill, sear the unseasoned steak until browned well on both sides, and cook to medium rare or desired temperature. Allow the steak to rest while you prepare the other ingredients.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. In a mortar and pestle, mash together the garlic and chilies to create a paste. Scrape the paste into a large bowl, and add the lime juice, fish sauce, and sugar. Mix well to dissolve the sugar. Add the thinly sliced onions, chives, and cilantro, and toss well to combine. Next, slice the steak into thin, even slices across the grain, and add to the salad. Mix again thoroughly and allow to marinate for at least 30 minutes for the flavors to meld. Serve with freshly steamed rice.</span><br />
