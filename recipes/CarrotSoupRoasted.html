	A toasty warm version of a traditional style carrot soup. - Reeve

Food52 Review: When we first tasted this soup, we were puzzled. How could a dish that calls for only seven ingredients (not counting salt and pepper), and just five simple steps, be so complex in flavor? Reeve has devised a soup that can be put together in about half an hour, yet would be a great first course for a dinner party. It's dairy-free, but supple and creamy, and roasting the carrots gives them sweet, earthy depth. We especially love Reeve's technique of infusing the broth with ginger before making the soup, ensuring a gentle but pervasive heat. We used a good quality vegetable stock, and we recommend you do the same -- since there are so few ingredients here, each one really counts. - A&M

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 carrots, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 cups vegetable stock (good quality, not too high in sodium)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 piece ginger, an inch long, peeled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 sprig thyme, plus more for garnish</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 onion, large sweet, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 garlic cloves, large, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">black pepper, Freshly ground</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Peel and cut the carrots into 1/2-inch rounds. On a rimmed baking sheet, toss the carrots with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and sprinkle generously with salt. Set an oven rack 6 to 8 inches from the heat source and turn on the broiler. Broil the carrots until they brown and soften, turning them over with a spatula every 5 minutes or so; this should take 15 to 20 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Meanwhile, bring the stock to a boil, add the ginger and the sprig of thyme and simmer gently for 15 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Put the onion in a medium stock pot with the remaining olive oil. Brown the onion over medium heat, stirring frequently. Add the garlic, and then add the carrots.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Remove the ginger and thyme from the stock and add the stock to the pot with the onions and carrots. Bring to boil and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, until the carrots are soft enough to puree.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Use an immersion or a standard blender to puree the mixture until smooth. If the soup seems too thick, add more stock or water and reheat gently. Add salt and pepper to taste. To serve, garnish with chopped fresh thyme.</span><br />
