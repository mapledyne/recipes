                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	I first came across Lablabi in an article in the Wall Street Journal. Gil Marks also includes a recipe in his book, Olive Trees and Honey. It is not too complicated, can be made with canned or dry chickpeas, and is garnished with a variety of piquant garnishes. The original recipe had you simply add crushed garlic, salt, and spices to the simmering chickpeas, serve it over a chunk of toasted baguette, and allow each diner to garnish as desired. Gil Marks has you saute carrots, celery root and onions. The stew fulfilled all of our family's basic requirements: chickpeas in any form are a favorite; lemony chickpeas, even better. And we always seem to have cured lemons, capers, and garlic on hand. I altered the recipe by sizzling the crushed garlic with spices and scallions and adding the fragrant mixture back into the pot of beans, saving some for a bright garnish. The technique of mashing garlic and salt with the spices to be used in the recipe hails from Jacquelin Higuera McMahon. It seems to round out the flavors.

<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 tablespoons olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 lemons</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">for garnish sun-dried tomatoes,, sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Harissa, for garnish</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">capers, Rinsed salt-packed or vinegar-packed, for garnish</span><br />

                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Toast cumin seeds and coriander seeds. Empty into a mortar and pestle and pound to a coarse powder. Scrape this powder into a dish and set aside. Toast the whole chile until darkened and soft. Slice off the stem end and, wearing rubber gloves, empty out the seeds. If you prefer heat, keep intact.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Scrape the mashed garlic into the mortar, add 2 teaspoons of the spice mix and a pinch of sea salt, and pound to a chunky paste. Scrape this out to a small dish, add the scallions to the mortar, and pound them too. Stir together with the garlic paste. Save remaining spice mix for another use (or, for a slightly more seasoned final dish, you could use the whole amount).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Take a heavy skillet, place it over medium low heat, and heat the oil. When hot, add the chile and toss and stir a second or three, then scrape in the garlic-scallion paste. Sizzle this mixture until fragrant and beginning to lose its bright color. Sniff appreciatively to avoid scorching the spices.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. You can pull out the chile at this point, or leave it in. Add the chickpeas  topping with more boiling water (about 2 to 3 cups or 2 to 3 inches) and bring to a simmer for 10 to 20 minutes. Taste for salt and adjust accordingly. Juice the lemons, strain the juice, and add to the pot. Simmer another minute or two.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Slice baguette into 3-inch slices and cut crosswise. Toast lightly in oven. Place a chunk of baguette in the bottom of each serving bowl, top with a ladleful of chickpeas, broth, and a drizzle of the rest of the spice paste, and hand around. Let each person garnish as he or she pleases.</span><br />
