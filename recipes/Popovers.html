                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups milk, whole, organic preferred</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 eggs, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups flour (try half AP half bread)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2-3 tablespoons butter, unsalted, melted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon salt</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Try adding grated cheddar cheese or Parmesan cheese for a savory version, or sugar and cinnamon for a sweet version. You can also pour the popover batter into a large cast iron pan (preheated), top with sliced fruit such as pears or peaches, and bake to make a large, tort-like breakfast pastry.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Don’t peek while these are baking! Opening the oven door will drop the air temperature, causing the popovers to drop in temperature and lose some of the steam that’s critical to their rise.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Traditionally, these are made in specialized popover cups, which are narrow cups with a slight slope to them and that have some heft to them, giving them good heat retention. You can use muffin tins or ramekins instead.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Whisk together in a mixing bowl or blend in a blender:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1 ½ cups (380g) whole milk</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3 large (180g) eggs</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1 ½ cups (180g) flour (try half AP, half bread)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1 tablespoon (15g) melted butter</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">½ teaspoon (2g) salt</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Preheat both the oven and the popover cups or muffin tin at 425°F / 220°C.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heavily grease the popover cups or muffin tins with butter: melt a few tablespoons of butter and put a teaspoon in the bottom of each cup. Fill each cup about ⅓ to ½ full with batter and bake. After 15 minutes, drop the temperature to 350°F / 175°C and continue baking until the outside is set and golden-dark brown, about another 20 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Serve at once with jam and butter.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">* * * * *</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">How does gluten affect the inside and crust of the popover? As an experiment, make two batches of the batter, one with either cake or AP flour and the second with a higher-gluten flour. Fill half the cups with one batter and the other half with the second batter and bake them at the same time to eliminate the potential for differences between runs.</span><br />
