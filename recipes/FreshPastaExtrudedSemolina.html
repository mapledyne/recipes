                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">360 grams (about 2 cups) semolina flour</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">120 grams water, warm</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Sprinkle a baking sheet with semolina flour and set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Put the flour in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with  the paddle attachment. With the mixed on high speed, very slowly drizzle water into the bowl. With half the water is incorporated, stop the machine and mix the flour with a wooden spoon or your hands to make sure the water is evenly distributed. Continue mixing and drilling until all the water is incorporated into the dough.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">The dough is ready to be extruded when it feels like wet sand - crumbly and almost flaky, barely holding together. If you squeeze a handful in your fist, it should stick together, slightly pulling on your skin.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Extrude the pasta following the manufacturer's directions for your machine or attachment. With a sharp knife, cut the noodles to the desired length as they emerge from the extruder and lay them on the prepared baking sheet to dry.</span><br />
