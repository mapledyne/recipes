                <span itemprop="description">
	Kim developed the bacon jam recipe a year ago, as one of the edibles in our homemade holiday gifts class. It was easily the runaway hit, and after 8 rounds of that class, the two of us ate an amount that remains a secret to this day. We filed the recipe away, moved on to a month-long salad fast, and forgot about days filled with bacon jam-smeared bread. When we were putting together the menu for our Apple Harvest Supper, the time was right to break out the jam and serve it up in the greatest bread vehicle known to man: the grilled cheese sandwich. 

I didn’t offer up a recipe for an actual grilled cheese, because I’m assuming we’ve all got that notch on our culinary belt. Let’s just make sure that we’re using squishy bread (I like potato bread), lots of butter, and nice sharp cheese. Beecher’s Flagship cheddar goes swimmingly with the bacon jam, so that’s what I used here.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces bacon Nueske's brand. Cherrywood smoked, green package (exact), cut crosswise into 1/2-inch strips</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 pounds (about 3) onions, yellow, peeled, thinly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 pounds (about 4) apples, sweet-tart, peeled, cored and chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 large garlic clove, peeled and minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup maple syrup, pure</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons vinegar, apple cider</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon mustard, smooth dijon</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt, Kosher, to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">black pepper, freshly ground, to taste</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">- Place the bacon in a dutch oven or large, straight-sided skillet and set over low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the fat has rendered and the bacon is starting to brown, about 20 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">- Add the onions, apple, and garlic clove to the bacon and continue to cook on low heat. Stir occasionally, scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to pick up all the fond. If the fond gets too thick and is starting to get too dark, add a couple tablespoons of water to deglaze the pan and continue caramelizing. Cook until the mixture has deeply caramelized, about 60 to 80 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">- Add the maple syrup, water, vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper. Turn the heat to medium-low, and deglaze the pan. Simmer until the liquid has nearly disappeared and turns syrupy.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">- Let the mixture cool a bit, then place in a blender. Blend just enough to break down the large pieces — the mixture should retain some texture, rather than becoming a smooth puree.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">- Transfer to an airtight container. Keep refrigerated for up to a month. Reheat before serving.</span><br />
