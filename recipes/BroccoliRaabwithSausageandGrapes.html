                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1.5 pounds broccoli raab (or broccoli)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound sausage, italian mild, no casings preffered</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 garlic cloves</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 pound grapes, seedless</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt and ground pepper, coarse</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Boil or steam the broccoli raab for about 3 minutes, until it is bright green and beginning to get tender. Drain and plunge it into ice water for a few moments and drain again. At this point, you may refrigerate the broccoli daab, wrapped well or in a converted, for up to 2 days.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cook the sausage over medium heat in a large, deep skillet, pricking it with a fork or thin-bladed knife a few times and turning from time to time., until it is nicely browned, 10-15 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove the sausage from the skillet (don't worry about it being done) and cut it into bite-sized pieces. Return it to the skillet over medium heat; cook, turning occasionally, until all sides of the sausage are nicely browned, about 5 more minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Squeeze the excess liquid from the broccoli daab and chop it coarsely. Add it to the skillet along with the garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3-4 minutes. Add the grapes and heat through. Check for salt and sprinkle liberally with pepper. Serve immediately.</span><br />
