                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	Adapted from a Madhur Jaffrey recipe, which was adapted over here because much to my frustration, I own two Madhur Jaffrey books and this is in neither

This is an intensely spiced bright orange chana masala with a sourish bite that reminded of us the best restaurant versions we’ve tasted. I’m thrilled to finally have a good recipe for it at home.

The major changes I made were simplifying the addition of spices, adding more tomatoes. 

Note: the recipe calls for a tablespoon of amchoor powder, which I did not have. I looked it up and learned that it was dried unripe mango powder (which sounds so delicious to me, I’m buying it next time I go to Kalustyan’s, who also sells it online), which is clearly a sour flavor, so I upped the lemon juice I used instead. The dish had a nice sour snap at the end, so I will presume this is a good swap.

<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon amchoor powder, (Optional - see note)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons paprika</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon garam masala</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 15-ounce can tomatoes, whole with their juices, chopped small</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2/3 cup water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 x 15-ounce cans chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained and rinsed</span><br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion, garlic, ginger and pepper and sauté over medium heat until browned, about 5 minutes. Turn heat down to medium-low and add the coriander, cumin, cayenne, turmeric, cumin seeds, amchoor (if using it), paprika and garam masala. Cook onion mixture with spiced for a minute or two, then add the tomatoes and any accumulated juices, scraping up any bits that have stuck to the pan. Add the water and chickpeas. Simmer uncovered for 10 minutes, then stir in salt and lemon juice.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Eat up or put a lid on it and reheat it when needed. Curries such as this reheat very well, later or in the days that follow, should it last that long.</span><br />
