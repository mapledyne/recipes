<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup white wine, dry</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cups vegetable stock</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 bay leaf</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons lemon juice</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon lemon zest</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 cup cream, heavy</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon vinegar, rice wine, plus more to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt & white pepper, to taste</span><br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Celery Root Soup:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Wash the outside of the leeks and then slice them into 1/2 inch rings, and then give them a second wash to ensure no dirt remains.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat a stockpot over medium heat and add in the oil. Once the oil is fragrant, but not smoking, add in the leeks and apples. Let them cook down for 3-4 minutes, stirring frequently, then add in the celery root and potatoes. Continue cooking for another 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and let the vegetables cook for 2 more minutes. A very light browning is okay, but you are not seeking deep caramelization.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add the white wine and turn the heat up to medium-high. Let the wine reduce by half, and add the vegetable stock, bay leaf, lemon juice and zest, cream, and vinegar. Add some salt and pepper and bring to a simmer.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Once the vegetables are soft (20-25 minutes), turn off the heat. Remove the bay leaf and puree the soup with a blender or food processor. Adjust the seasoning as necessary to your tastes. If the soup seems a little thick, simply add in a little extra vegetable stock or a combination of water and cream.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bacon Lardons:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place the bacon and water in a small oven-safe saute pan and cook over medium heat until the water is gone and the bacon has rendered most of its fat, about 5 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Move the pan to the oven and bake, stirring every five minutes, until crisp (10-15 minutes). Strain the bacon grease and reserve it for the popovers. Place the bacon on paper towels and set aside.</span><br />
