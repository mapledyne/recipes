                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	All it takes is 30 minutes in a simple 1/4 cup salt, 4 cup water brine solution, for the chicken breasts to absorb enough moisture so they can better hold up to the heat of the grill without drying out.

After half an hour the salt that is absorbed isn’t so much as to make your chicken salty, but enough so that the flavor of the chicken is enhanced. We would normally salt the meat, right? Don’t need to do that if you brine.

Then it’s a simple rub with paprika (great for color) and olive oil (no sticking on the grill), and onto the hot side of the grill it goes for searing, and the cool side for finishing. And you have beautifully grilled, perfectly juicy chicken breasts!

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 cups water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup salt, kosher</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 to 2 pounds chicken breasts, boneless skinless</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 Tbsp olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 teaspoons paprika</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1 Brine the chicken breast: Use a whisk to dissolve the salt in the water in a large bowl. Add the chicken breasts to the brine. Put in refrigerator and chill for 30 minutes to 1 hour.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2 Prepare your grill: Arrange your grill so that one side is for high direct heat, and the other side is cooler.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Alternatively, you can use a grill pan, heat on medium high heat.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3 Coat chicken with oil and paprika: Remove chicken breasts from brine and pat dry. Coat with olive oil, and sprinkle evenly with paprika.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4 Grill the chicken breasts: Brush some olive oil on the grill grates. Place chicken breasts on the hot side of the grill (or on the grill pan). Let grill without moving, until the chicken pieces start getting some grill marks (you can lift up one to check).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">When the chicken pieces have browned on one side, turn them over, and move them to the cooler side of the grill. Cover, and let finish cooking.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove chicken from grill when the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 150°F.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5 Let the chicken breasts rest: Cover the breasts with foil to rest. The chicken will continue to cook in its residual heat while it rests. Let it rest 5 to 10 minutes before cutting into it.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Serve with grilled peppers, pineapple salsa, or just a squeeze of lime!</span><br />
