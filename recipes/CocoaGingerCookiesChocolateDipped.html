                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/4 cup (175 g) flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup (30 g) cocoa powder, unsweetened</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon baking soda</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 stick plus 3 tablespoons (150 g) butter, unsalted, room temperature</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2/3 cup (120 g) sugar, brown, firmly packed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup (50 g) sugar, granulated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon salt, kosher</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 ounces ginger, candied</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 ounces chocolate, bittersweet, fine minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt, Flaky sea, for finishing</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Note: If measuring by volume, it's important to measure the flour and cocoa lightly, as follows: stir flour briefly in the container or bag, spoon into the measuring cup until it's heaped above the rim, then level it with a straight-edged knife or spatula. If you dip the measuring cup into the container, you'll have more flour and cocoa and a drier, crumblier, more difficult dough.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">- Sift the flour, cocoa, and baking soda together into a medium bowl. Whisk to evenly blend.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">- Working with a stand mixer, preferably fitted with a paddle attachment, or with a hand mixer in a large bowl, beat the butter on medium speed until soft and creamy. Add brown sugar, white sugar, salt, and vanilla extract, and beat for 2 minutes more.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">- Turn off the mixer. Pour in the dry ingredients and pulse the mixer at low speed about 5 times, a second or two each time. Take a peek, if there is still a lot of flour on the surface of the dough, pulse a couple of times more. Continuing at low speed, mix for about 30 seconds more, just until the flour disappears into the dough, for the best texture, work the dough as little as possible once the flour is added, and don't be concerned if the dough looks a little crumbly. Toss in the candied ginger pieces and mix only to incorporate.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">- Turn the dough out onto a work surface, gather it together and divide it in half. Working with one half at a time, shape the dough into logs that are 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap the logs in plastic wrap and refrigerate them for at least 3 hours. (The dough can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 2 months. If you've frozen the dough, you needn't defrost it before baking — just slice the logs into cookies and bake the cookies 1 minute longer.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">- Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 325 °F. Line two baking sheets with parchment or silicone mats.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">- Using a sharp thin knife, slice the logs into rounds that are 1/4-inch thick. (The rounds are likely to crack as you're cutting them; don't be concerned, just squeeze the bits back onto each cookie.) Arrange the rounds on the baking sheets, leaving about 1 inch between them.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">- Bake the cookies one sheet at a time for 12 minutes, they won't look done, nor will they be firm, but that's just the way they should be. Transfer the baking sheet to a cooling rack and let the cookies rest until they reach room temperature.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">- Fill a saucepan halfway with water and bring to a simmer. Place the chocolate in a dry, heatproof bowl and set over the simmering water. Melt, stirring occasionally. Set aside to cool slightly.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">- Dip the cookies in the melted chocolate halfway and place on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Sprinkle some flaky salt on top to finish. Let chocolate harden before serving or packing.</span><br />
