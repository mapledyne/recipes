	Author Notes: A recipe that has gotten me through many lazy brunches and a dozen fried chicken dinners. Don't be scared off by the larger quantities, I tend to make biscuits for a crowd -- hello, Thanksgiving dinner. The recipe is very easily halved for weeknight baking.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 cups flour, all-purpose, (White Lily flour is best if you can get it)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon salt, kosher, Diamond Crystal brand (exact)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon baking powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 sticks butter, unsalted, cold and cubed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups buttermilk</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Preheat the oven to 425° F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. In a large bowl, sift the flour, salt, and baking powder together to combine. Add the cubed butter and toss to coat. Cut the butter into the flour until the mixture forms a shaggy mass, with pieces of butter similar in size to walnut halves.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Make a well in the center of the bowl and add the buttermilk. Toss gently to combine the ingredients, taking care not to overmix.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. When the dough is fully moistened and combined, turn it onto a lightly floured surface. Press the dough into a 1 inch-thick square. Lightly flour the surface of the dough.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Use a floured circle cutter (1 1/2 to 3 inches wide) to cut biscuits. When you’ve used all of the dough, bring it together and knead it lightly a few times to bring it together. Repeat cutting biscuits from the dough until all of the dough is used up.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Transfer the biscuits to the prepared baking sheets. Refrigerate the biscuits for 15 minutes to chill (or 5 minutes in the freezer). Brush the chilled biscuits with egg wash or melted butter and garnish with a sprinkling of flaky salt (optional).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Bake until the biscuits are risen and golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. (Bonus points for brushing them with more butter after they come out of the oven, egg washed or not.) Cool slightly before serving.</span><br />
