                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	These goat cheese pops are like your own personal cheese ball. Each bite is the perfect balance of soft cheese, crumbled bacon, and crushed nuts.

I’ve made these goat cheese lollipops for many different occasions over the years, from holiday gatherings to cocktail parties. Each time, people ask for the recipe.

It’s one of those appetizers that people always remember and request again and again. For me, that’s a sign of success.



The “recipe” couldn’t be easier. Just blend fresh goat cheese and cream cheese with a little bit of honey (for a touch of sweetness). Then roll the cheese into balls and coat each one with a crunchy, wildly flavorful mix of bacon, pecans, dried cherries, and herbs.

The dried cherries can easily be replaced with dried cranberries or blueberries – heck, you could even do dried apricots or figs, if you like! Pistachios are also a fabulous alternative to the pecans, and they look beautiful too.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 slices bacon</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 ounces cheese, goat</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 ounces cream cheese</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon honey</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">pinch of chili flakes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup cherries, dried</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup herbs, fresh, lightly packed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup pecan halves, unsalted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">skewers, Appetizer</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Cook the bacon: In a skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon until crispy. Drain on a paper towel. This can be done several days in advance; store in the fridge until needed.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Make the cheese mix: In a food processor, combine goat cheese, cream cheese, honey, chili flakes (if using), a pinch of salt and a pinch of pepper. Blitz for about 30 seconds, then scrape down the sides of the bowl and pulse a few more times to fully combine. Transfer to a small bowl and freeze for 10 to 20 minutes, until firm but not frozen solid. (The cheese can be mixed up to 2 days in advance; store in the fridge.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Make the bacon topping: While the cheese mix is chilling, clean your food processor to make your filling. Place the dried cherries in the food processor and blend in 1-second pulses until they’re chopped into tiny bits. Add herbs and pulse another 5 or so times. Add bacon and pecans and pulse until the mixture looks crumbly. Do not over-mix or you will end up with bacony nut butter. Transfer coating to a bowl.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Roll the cheese into balls: Remove the cheese mixture from the freezer and roll into twelve little balls (a scant tablespoon each). Wetting your hands in cool water helps to cut down on the mess.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Roll the cheese balls in the bacon topping: Gently press the coating into the cheese to make it stick.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Stick a small stick or skewer into your cheese balls and store in the fridge until you’re ready to serve. The pops are best the day they are made, but will keep just fine in the fridge for several hours before serving.</span><br />
