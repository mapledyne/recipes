                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound broccoli or broccolini</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 garlic cloves, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">A few pinches red pepper flakes, to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 lemon, Finely grated zest, then juiced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt, coarse, to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup cheese, pecorino Romano, finely grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 thin slices provolone cheese, totally unfancy deli</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 slices bread of your choice</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">If using broccolini, cut it into 2-inch segments. If regular broccoli, peel the stems with a vegetable peeler first so that they cook evenly, and cut the rest into large chunks.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Pour about 1-inch puddle of salted water into a large sauté pan and bring to a boil. Add broccoli and cover with a lid and boil/steam for 2 minutes. Drain well and pat dry on paper towels, wringing out as much extra liquid as possible. Chop into small (roughly 1/2-inch) bits.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Wipe sauté pan dry and heat over medium. Add olive oil and let it heat for a full minute. Add garlic and pepper flakes, cooking for 1 minutes, or until the garlic is just beginning to turn golden. Add the broccoli and cook 1 to 2 minutes more, seasoning with salt. Transfer mixture to a bowl and add lemon zest, juice, pecorino and more salt and pepper flakes to taste.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat broiler. Arrange slices of bread on a tray and lightly toast on both sides. Scoop broccoli mixture onto each slice of bread, lay a slice of provolone over it and run under the broiler until cheese has melted and begun to blister. Eat. Repeat. Don’t forget to share, or at least hide the evidence if you decide not to.</span><br />
