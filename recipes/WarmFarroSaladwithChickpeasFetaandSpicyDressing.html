                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup farro</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 tsp salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tbsp fish sauce</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tbsp limes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 to 3 tbsp sugar, dark brown</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 to 8 tbsp water, to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 medium garlic clove, minced or pressed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 Thai chile, very thinly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">chickpeas (garbanzo beans), either canned (drained and rinsed) or cooked from dried</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Escarole, coarsely chopped or sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Radicchio, coarsely sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Carrots, sliced into rounds</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Feta, green and yellow package, vacuum sealed, preferred, coarsely crumbled</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Put the farro in a medium (2 ½- to 3-quart) saucepan, add cold water to cover, and set it aside to soak for 30 minutes. Then drain the farro, put it back into the saucepan, and add 3 cups of cold water and ½ teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil; then reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until tender but still a little chewy, about 45 minutes. It’s up to you, really, how “done” you want your farro. At 30 minutes, mine is usually too tough, but a few minutes later, it’s just right: al dente, but not exhausting to chew. When it’s ready, drain it, and either use it while it’s warm or transfer it to a storage container for later use. (Covered and chilled, cooked farro will keep for a few days, easy.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">To make the dressing, combine the fish sauce, lime juice, 2 tablespoons of the brown sugar, 6 tablespoons of the water, the garlic, and chile in a small bowl. Whisk well. Taste: if it’s too pungent, add more water 1 tablespoon at a time. If you’d like a little more sweetness, add more brown sugar ½ tablespoon at a time. (Covered and chilled, the dressing will keep for three days to a week.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">To assemble a portion of salad, scoop out a couple of large spoonfuls of farro – maybe 1/3 to ½ cup – and put it in a wide bowl. If the farro is cold, you might want to microwave it for 45 seconds or so, to warm it. That’s what I do. Or you could put it in a small ovenproof dish, covered, and bake it for a few minutes to warm it. Or you can just leave it cold. Add a large spoonful of chickpeas, a good handful each of escarole and radicchio, and maybe half of a carrot, sliced. Top with a generous amount of feta, and then drizzle some dressing – maybe a tablespoon? Or to taste – over the whole thing. Toss, and eat.</span><br />
