                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	This dish is a great solution for when you fancy a roast chicken dinner but don’t have much time. This recipe is from my book, Moving out... Eating in. When you share a house, it's best to keep washing to a minimum, which is why I love this one-pot dish. Serve it with mashed potatoes and green beans and drizzle the lot with the garlic and white wine gravy. The best part is you can have the whole meal on the table in less than 30 minutes. (Please do yourself a favor and buy a good-quality, free-range chicken.)

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">One 3 1/3 pound chicken, whole free-range, skin-on, cut into eight pieces and backbone removed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 garlic bulb, halved</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 sprigs thyme, fresh, divided</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup chicken stock</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup white wine, divided</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon flour, all-purpose</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Preheat oven to 400° F (200° C). Season the chicken with salt and pepper, as desired.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Put a large, deep roasting pan on the stove over high heat. (Using a roasting pan instead of a frying pan not only saves on the washing time but also means you can use the chicken juices in your gravy.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Put the garlic, half the thyme, and the oil in the roasting tin. Add the chicken pieces, skin-side down, and cook, without stirring, for 5 to 6 minutes or until the chicken skin is crisp and golden. Turn off the heat.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Turn the chicken over and gently, without pouring directly over the skin, pour the stock and 1/2 cup wine into the pan. This will ensure the skin stays crisp. Place the remaining thyme on top of the chicken and bake for 15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Arrange the chicken on a serving plate.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Put the roasting pan on the stove over medium heat and use a fork to mash the garlic flesh. Use a wooden spoon to mix in the flour, then, whisking continuously with a fork, add the remaining 1/2 cup wine to deglaze the pan (make sure you scrape all the sticky goodness off the bottom). Simmer for a few minutes or until thickened.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Serve the chicken with the gravy drizzled on top (and some mashed potatoes and steamed greens on the side!).</span><br />
