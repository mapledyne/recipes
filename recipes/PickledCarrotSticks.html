                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	But since carrot sticks are inherently good, and good for you things, I see no reason to throw them out with the resolutions bathwater. Because what if that, uh, bathwater was bright and tangy? What if had a buttery dill vibe? What if it had a kick of garlic? What if you pickled your carrot sticks? If you were me, you would not be able to keep your tongs out of the jar. I had one of those “oh, let me try one and see how they came out” moments before I went to work Thursday morning. Then I tried another one. And another. Um, I had pickled carrot sticks for breakfast–I am gross. But these are not.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound carrots, cut into 3 1/2- by 1/3-inch sticks</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/4 cups water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup vinegar, cider or plain (the former makes a sweeter, milder brine)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 garlic cloves, lightly crushed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 tablespoons dill seeds</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 tablespoons salt</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place carrots in a heatproof bowl. Bring remaining ingredients to a boil in saucepan, then reduce heat and simmer 2 minutes. Pour pickling liquid over carrots and cool, uncovered. Chill carrots, covered, at least 1 day for flavors to develop.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Carrots keep, chilled in an airtight container, 1 month.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">* From my own experience, and from comments I have received, I’ve learned that dill seeds aren’t always the easiest thing to find. Mine are from McCormick, but they were also the only bottle I could find in the two different stores I went to. If you can’t find them, use fresh or dried dill instead. You can put the dried dill in with the brine as you boil it. If fresh dill, I would drop it in the container your are storing the carrots in, just before you put them in the fridge.</span><br />
