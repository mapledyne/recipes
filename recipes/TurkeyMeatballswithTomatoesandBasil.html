                <span itemprop="description">
	That said, meatballs made with ground turkey can tend to be on the dry side.

To counter that for our turkey meatballs we add some sour cream to the mix, in addition to breadcrumbs. It works!

We also use ground turkey thigh meat, which we are able to get at our local butcher. If you can get ground thighs, I recommend it. Not only will they be more moist because thigh meat is fattier than breast meat, but also more flavorful.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 pounds turkey, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup sour cream</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup bread crumbs</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons salt, kosher</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons basil, fresh, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon thyme, dried</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon fennel seeds</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons rosemary, fresh, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon oregano, dried</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup flour, for dredging</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 jalapeno chile, seeded, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 garlic cloves, large, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons white wine or chicken stock</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 pounds tomatoes, fresh, roughly chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup basil, fresh, thinly sliced</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1 Make the turkey meatball mix: In a large bowl, place the turkey, bread crumbs, sour cream, egg, minced basil, salt, minced rosemary, oregano, thyme, fennel seeds, and red pepper flakes. Gently mix together using your (clean) hands.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2 Form the meatballs and dredge them in flour: Place flour in a shallow bowl or plate. Use the palms of your hands to form 1 1/2 to 2-inch wide meatballs.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Roll the meatballs in the dredging flour and set them on a plate or tray. You should have about 18 to 22 meatballs.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3 Brown the turkey meatballs in olive oil: Heat the olive oil over medium high heat in a large, shallow sauté pan. Gently place the meatballs in the pan. You may need to work in batches as to not crowd the pan.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Once the meatballs are sizzling, reduce the heat to medium low and gently cook them on at least 3 sides, so that they get browned pretty much all over, and cooked through.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Use a fork to nudge the meatballs in the pan. Cooking the meatballs should take about 10 minutes per batch. A gentle heat will ensure that the browned meatballs get cooked through.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Use a slotted spoon to remove the meatballs from the pan to bowl, set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4 Make the sauce base: Add the jalapeño and garlic to the pan and cook for 1 minute. Add the white wine or chicken stock. Increase the heat to high and boil down the liquid to the point where a wooden spoon leaves a trail through the pan as you scrape it along the bottom of the pan.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5 Return meatballs to pan, add tomatoes: Return the meatballs to the pan with the sauce and coat all over with the pan sauce.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add the fresh tomatoes and toss to coat. Cook for four minutes or until the tomatoes just begin to break down. Do not overcook the tomatoes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the fresh basil.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6 Serve with freshly grated cheese: Serve with fresh mozzarella, parmesan or pecorino cheese. Serve alone or with pasta, rice, or in a sandwich roll.</span><br />
