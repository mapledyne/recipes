                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	My mom isn’t actually Greek, but she married one, and so her souvlaki recipe is a bit unorthodox: She didn’t use beef, but rather the elk, deer—whatever hunter patrons at her and my dad’s restaurant would bring in from their recent kill. One of my first memories is sitting on the prep table the restaurant in Ogden, Utah, watching my mom season huge tubs of cubed pork or turkey for souvlaki. 

When I told my mom that I was going to enter the 2008 beef cook-off with a souvlaki recipe, she thought I was nuts, but in true competitive spirit, I did anyway. And you know what? I won: a $300 prize, my largest prize to date.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 pounds beef, sirloin, pork or chicken breasts, cubed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup soy sauce</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 - 2 lemons, large, juiced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon salt, kosher</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon pepper, coarsely ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon garlic, granulated or two fresh cloves, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons Italian seasoning, or herbs de Provence</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons parsley leaves, flat-leaf fresh</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Toss all ingredients together in bowl and mix well. Marinate the meat for at least 30 minutes or overnight.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Skewer meat onto soaked bamboo skewers (just soak them in water for a while so they won't splinter, or catch on fire—haha). You can usually fit four to five pieces per stick. When I make this using chicken, I always add zucchini and red onion between each piece of meat.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Grill or broil depending on cut of meat used, around five minutes on each side.</span><br />
