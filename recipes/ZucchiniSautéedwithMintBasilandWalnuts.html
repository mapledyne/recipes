	I like to carve out a corner of my serving dish, dollop on a big pile of ricotta, and serve everything together with thick slices of crusty bread. It also makes for some mean crostini.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound zucchini, sliced into 1/2-inch rounds</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 small cloves garlic</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">10 mint leaves</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 basil leaves</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 heaping tablespoon capers, rinsed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons walnuts or pine nuts, lightly toasted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoons vinegar, red wine</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Sea salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Additional mint and basil, torn, to garnish</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">ricotta cheese, fresh, (optional)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">bread, crusty, (optional)</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Heat half of your olive oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add half the zucchini and sauté, flipping and turning every few minutes, until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Don't salt them yet!</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. While your zucchini cooks, chop together the garlic, mint, basil, and capers so that they intermingle and turn into a sort of knife pesto.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. When the zucchini is golden, remove it from the pan and cook the remaining zucchini in the remaining oil, just as you did the first batch. Then add the first batch back into the pan, along with the herb-garlic mixture and the vinegar, to taste. Taste for salt; add a good pinch, plus a few cracks of pepper. Toss well.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Scoop everything out onto a serving plate. Right before serving, sprinkle on the nuts and extra herbs as a garnish.</span><br />
