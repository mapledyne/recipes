This comes from David Rosengarten's Tastings email newsletter. Be sure and visit drosengarten.com to sign up for his mailings and for more recipe ideas.
You can also replace the red beans with a firm, creamy bean like Midnight Black Bean.
"I love the recipe for Red Beans and Rice that appears in my newest cookbook, It's ALL American Food--developed by me and Susan Bird, my crack Cajun recipe-tester. Just buy some red kidney beans at your supermarket, get some good rice and have yourself a feast! If you wish to add andouille, tasso or chicken to this recipe, to make it meatier still . . . go right ahead!" - David Rosengarten

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound beans, dried (such as Red Nightfall or Sangre de Toro)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 onion, large, finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 green pepper, small, finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 celery stalks, finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 garlic cloves, large, finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 jalapeño, fresh, finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon vegetable oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">10 1/2-ounce can chicken broth</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup red wine</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cups water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 bay leaf</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound ham hocks, smoked</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups white rice, cooked</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">(optional) scallions for garnish, chopped</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Wash beans well and sort through them, removing any pebbles or impurities. Place beans in a pot, cover with water and soak overnight.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. When ready to cook, drain beans and set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Sauté onion, green pepper, celery, garlic and jalapeño in oil in a large stock pot over medium-high heat, uncovered, until soft (about 10 minutes).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Add beans to the pot, along with chicken broth, red wine, water, bay leaf, ham hocks, cayenne pepper and black pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and taste to adjust seasoning. Simmer, covered, for 2 hours, stirring frequently.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Remove ham hocks after 2 hours. Continue to simmer beans for another 30 minutes, or until the liquid in the beans has a thick, creamy consistency.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. As soon as the ham hocks are cool enough to work with, remove all meat from the bones, and shred it. Return meat to the beans.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Divide the hot rice among 4 wide, shallow serving bowls. Pour 1 1/2 cups of the bean mixture over the rice in each bowl; you'll have a little bean mixture left over.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">8. Garnish with scallions and serve immediately.</span><br />
