                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	I have always had a "thing" for raw celery in salad. It has to do with texture - the crunchy factor that celery delivers. It lends itself well to so many other flavors. Here, it is paired with lightly sauteed mushrooms, parmesan cheese, and lemon vinaigrette. It makes a nice side at dinner, but it is equally as delicious with a slice of baguette for lunch.

Food52 Review: WHO: Waverly, a lawyer-turned-full-time-mom, wholesome meal advocate and all around super home cook! 
WHAT: A delicate yet satisfying salad of celery and mushroom. 
HOW: Just a little slicing and squeezing and in almost no time, you're looking at one beautiful dish. 
WHY WE LOVE IT: Earthy sauteed mushrooms and parmesan pack a lovely umami punch, bringing perfect balance to the crunch of the celery and zing of the lemon. We could happily eat this salad every day.  (less)
