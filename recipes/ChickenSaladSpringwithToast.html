                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	While I don’t have any tremendous gripe with traditional chicken salad (yes, even with mayo; I save my contempt for curry powder and raisins), I have forever had little love or tolerance for white meat. The archives here are thick with my referring to breast cutlets as pressed sawdust and worse; it could never be argued that I don’t know how to form an opinion. Thus, it surprises nobody more than me that I want to eat these everyday for the rest of my life, or at least the next month, and all it took was shifting the way we usually emphasize ingredients.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 (about 12 to 14 ounces) chicken breast, large skin-on, bone-in or boneless.</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt, Kosher</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">black pepper, freshly ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon vinegar, white wine</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cucumber, small such as a Persian variety, halved, thinly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 celery rib, small, sliced thin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 radishes, quartered lengthwise, sliced thin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 scallion, sliced thin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon dill, chives or parsley, or a mix, chopped for garnish</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons creme fraiche</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 teaspoons horseradish, prepared, liquid drained off a little, plus more to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 to 3 thin slices bread, dense and healthy, toasted</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat oven to 425°. Place chicken on a small rimmed baking sheet and rub with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and roast until golden brown and cooked through, about 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool, then remove skin and bones and shred meat into bite-sized pieces.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place shredded chicken in a medium bowl and toss with 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper until evenly coated. Add cucumber, celery, radishes and scallion to salad and toss to combine. Adjust salt, pepper and vinegar to taste.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">If you need horseradish crème fraîche in your life — I know I always do — combine crème fraîche, horseradish and a couple pinches salt in a small dish and stir to combine.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heap salad on 2 to 3 toasts (i.e. more on 2 or less on 3). Dollop with horseradish creme fraiche, if using, and garnish with herbs.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Do Ahead: Chicken can be cooked 2 days ahead; cover and chill. Shred just before using.</span><br />
