                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">A scant 2 tbsp butter, unsalted, divided</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 oz artichoke hearts, package frozen, thawed overnight in the refrigerator</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 shallot, medium, peeled, halved and thinly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">A generous 1/4 pound baby spinach, washed and spun dry</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 eggs, large, poached according to the directions here</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano, finely shredded, divided</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">pepper, ground</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place a 12” skillet over low heat, and add 1 tablespoon of the butter. When it has melted and begins to foam, add the artichoke hearts. Cook, covered, until they are softened and fully thawed; then raise the heat to medium and continue to cook, uncovered, stirring and shaking the pan, until they are golden in spots. They should smell wonderfully buttery. Add the remaining butter and the shallots, and cook, stirring frequently, until the shallots are softened and lightly caramelized. Add the spinach and a good pinch of salt, and cook, stirring gently, until just wilted.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Divide the spinach and artichokes between two medium gratin dishes or shallow ramekins. [I used the latter, roughly 4 ½ inches in diameter and 2 inches deep.] Sprinkle half of the cheese over the two dishes. Top each dish with a poached egg; then sprinkle the remaining cheese over the eggs.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Working quickly and carefully, use a blowtorch to melt the cheese on top: it should bubble lightly and turn golden brown in spots. Serve immediately, seasoning with salt and pepper at the table.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Yield: 2 servings</span><br />
