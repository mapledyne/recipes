                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 tablespoons butter, unsalted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cups leeks, chopped white and light green parts (2 leeks)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup fennel, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups rice, Arborio</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2/3 cup white wine, dry</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 cups chicken stock, simmering preferably homemade</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound asparagus, thin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">10 ounces frozen peas, defrosted, or 11/2 cups peas</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon lemon zest (2 lemons), freshly grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons lemon juice, freshly squeezed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup cheese, mascarpone, preferably Italian</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup cheese, Parmesan, freshly grated plus extra for serving</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons chives, fresh, minced fresh plus extra for serving</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the olive oil and butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the leeks and fennel and sauté for 5 to 7 minutes, until tender. Add the rice and stir for a minute to coat with the vegetables, oil, and butter. Add the white wine and simmer over low heat, stirring constantly, until most of the wine has been absorbed. Add the chicken stock, 2 ladles at a time, stirring almost constantly and waiting for the stock to be absorbed before adding more. This process should take 25 to 30 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, cut the asparagus diagonally in 1½-inch lengths and discard the tough ends. Blanch in boiling salted water for 4 to 5 minutes, until al dente. Drain and cool immediately in ice water. (If using fresh peas, blanch them in boiling water for a few minutes until the starchiness is gone.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">When the risotto has been cooking for 15 minutes, drain the asparagus and add it to the risotto with the peas, lemon zest, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Continue cooking and adding stock, stirring almost constantly, until the rice is tender but still firm.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Whisk the lemon juice and mascarpone together in a small bowl. When the risotto is done, turn off the heat and stir in the mascarpone mixture plus the Parmesan cheese and chives. Set aside off the heat for a few minutes, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and serve hot with a sprinkling of chives and more Parmesan cheese.</span><br />
