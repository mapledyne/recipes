                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	There is both brown sugar and honey in the tofu marinade, so I anticipated this to be a bit too sweet but it turned out great! I could eat these as a snack or in a stir fry like the author suggests. One note: so the tofu gets more color and crispness, I would fry these with less than 1/4 cup of oil.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound tofu, extra firm</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup miso paste, shiro (white miso)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup ponzu sauce</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup sugar, dark brown</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup honey</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons rice vinegar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons mirin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 teaspoons wasabi paste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 tablespoons ginger paste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 cloves garlic, finely minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup vegetable oil, for frying</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Gently press the block of tofu after wrapping it in paper towels. You'll see a lot of water coming out, but make sure you don't press too hard as you don't want it to crumble. Once most of the moisture has been pressed out, cut into 1 1/2 inch cubes. Set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Mix all the rest of the ingredients, except for the oil, in a glass bowl. Submerge the tofu pieces in the marinade and park it in the fridge for at least 24 hours to up to 48 hours (like I did). Give it a shake every now and then.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Heat a big skillet and pour enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the pan. On medium heat add the pieces of tofu in a single layer. Be careful, it is going to splatter like crazy!! Using tongs GENTLY turn them around and fry them on all sides. Once they are nicely browned on all sides, drain them on a paper towel.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. You could have the tofu as it is, or you could use it with your favorite stir fry, on salads, in wraps or sandwiches. Enjoy!</span><br />
