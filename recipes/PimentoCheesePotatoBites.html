                <span itemprop="description">
	This will make twice as much pimento cheese as you need. You can halve the cheese mixture so everything lines up, use double the potatoes (which you totally should for a crowd) or you can save the extra pimento cheese for everything that’s amazing with pimento cheese (grilled cheese and omelets are my top picks, my friends say we should put it on celery). You can easily pre-prep these, either by mixing the pimento cheese and boiling the potatoes one day (they’re easier to work with when cold, anyway) and chilling the potatoes for up to two days and the pimento cheese for up to a week, if needed, or by fully assembling them and baking them right before a party. They also reheat well. You can use the same approach for twice-baked full-sized potatoes, hooray. 

Some potato-scooping tips: There’s a temptation to scoop them all out perfectly, but I find scooping out shallow round is sufficient once remixed to have a fully-flavored potato and it’s only when I attempt to cut further that I cut holes in the bottoms or rip the sides. Even if you do, however, the oiled foil will keep it from being too much of a mess.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 pounds (680 grams) potatoes, baby (I used a mix of red and yellow)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 heaped cups (8 ounces or 225 grams) cheese, cheddar, ideally a mix of yellow and white - coarsely grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4-ounce jar pimentos or roasted red peppers, finely chopped drained</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup (50 grams) mayonnaise</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 to 2 scallions, finely minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon salt, celery</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Cayenne or hot sauce, to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt and freshly ground pepper</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">paprika, · Smoked hot or sweet, more cayenne chipotle powder and/or minced chives, to garnish (these can be found in the asian food section of your supermarket)</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Put potatoes in a large pot, cover them with two inches of water, set them over high heat and set your time — as soon as you turn on the flame — for 25 minutes and bring to a boil. When the timer rings, the potatoes are either done or need up to 5 minutes more. If a skewer goes in them easily, they’re done. Drain and let cool until you can pick them up. Or, you can chill them for up to 2 days, until needed.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, make the pimento cheese by mixing the cheddar(s), pimentos, mayo, scallions, celery salt and cayenne or hot sauce together until evenly combined. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Either use this right away or keep it chilled for a week, until needed.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cover a large baking sheet with foil and lightly coat foil with nonstick spray. Heat oven to 425 degrees.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">When potatoes are cool enough to handle, halve lengthwise and scoop out all but the last 1/4-inch thickness of skin and potato (essentially, you want to leave a shell inside for stability). A melon baller makes easy work of this. Arrange potatoes on prepared baking sheet. Season cavities with salt and pepper. Mash the potato centers in a bowl until smooth and mix with half (3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon) of prepared pimento cheese. Season with more salt and pepper to taste. Use a small spoon, butter knife or small offset spatula to press/pack filling back into emptied potatoes, smoothing the tops. Nestle them in the pan tightly to discourage them from toppling and spilling their contents.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bake 15 to 20 minutes, until melty and sizzling, then run under broiler until lightly browned on top. Let cool 5 to 10 minutes before serving, garnishing with paprika and/or chives when you do.</span><br />
