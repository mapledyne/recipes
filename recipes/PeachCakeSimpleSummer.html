	Author Notes: This particular flavor combination comes from my childhood -- on summer mornings my mother would fix me a bowl of cut up peaches with milk, sprinkled with sugar and a dusting of nutmeg. Although that's a pretty sublime combination, the flavors translate well to cake form. - Savour (less) —Savour

Food52 Review: We had high hopes for this peach cake, and we weren't disappointed. We love Savour's headnote about childhood breakfasts served to her by her mother of peaches, milk, sugar and nutmeg, which were the inspiration for this recipe. The cake is chock full of juicy summer peaches, and the addition of ground almonds sets it apart from other simple butter cakes. It's luscious and a bit custardy in the areas surrounding the peaches -- a texture that works when the cake is either warm or at room temperature. Don't be alarmed if the batter seems to curdle when you add the buttermilk, as it will come together again once you mix in the dry ingredients. - A&M (less) —The Editors

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 peaches, ripe</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 teaspoon nutmeg, freshly ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 tablespoons butter, unsalted, softened</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup buttermilk</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon almond extract</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup flour, almond</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon baking powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon baking soda</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">sugar, Turbinado</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter and flour a 9-inch cake pan.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Cut the peaches into bite sized pieces. Toss the peaches with nutmeg and 2 tablespoons sugar. Set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Cream together the butter and remaining sugar with a wooden spoon or spatula. Add the egg, buttermilk and extracts, and stir to combine.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Combine the flours, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add this flour mixture to the butter mixture, mix until smooth (some lumps may remain). Pour into the prepared pan.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Press the peaches into the top of the cake. They can be nicely arranged, but I like to cram as many peaches as possible into the cake. Sprinkle turbinado sugar over the top.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the oven heat to 325 degrees and bake for an additional 45 to 55 minutes, or until a toothpick in the center comes out clean.</span><br />
