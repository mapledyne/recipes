                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 x 15-ounce block extra firm tofu (do not use firm or silken)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon olive oil, extra virgin</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1.Unwrap tofu. Lightly blot with paper towels to remove excess moisture. Slice block into 1-inch thick strips. Reassemble block, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and freeze for 3 hours our up to 2 months.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2.When ready to cook, remove tofu from freezer and unwrap. Bring a pot of water large enough to completely submerge the tofu to a boil. Gently slip frozen tofu block into the water (no need to break apart the strips.) Reduce heat to a gentle simmer. Continue simmering for 10-15 minutes, until tofu floats. Remove immediately and set aside on a paper towel-lined plate to cool. Once tofu is cool enough to touch, carefully separate any strips that have not yet come apart. Cut strips into 1/2 to 3/4 inch-wide pieces.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3.In a large wok or skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat until very hot but not smoking. Add tofu pieces in a single layer. Let cook for a few minutes on one side, then with a heat-proof spatula, turn the tofu pieces so that all sides brown, cooking for a few minutes on each side. Once tofu is lightly browned and crispy (about 10 minutes), remove from pan. Use in your favorite stir fry, dip in peanut sauce, or add to soups or stews</span><br />
