                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	Fish has always intimidated me. I'm not sure why. It probably stems from growing up in a house where fish wasn't cooked -- well, except for a few meals of fried catfish. Not long ago I decided to take the plunge and jump in feet first. I wish I hadn't waited so long -- baked fish is so easy! When you buy your fish, be sure that it doesn't smell too fishy. Fresh fish will be best, but frozen will work fine. Also, ask the cute fish guy for a cut that is pretty consistent in thickness from one end to the other. If they are customer-oriented, they will do so with a smile on their face. If not, find another cute fish guy.
