Another thing that blew my mind about this sauce: I, for one, am a grated parmesan junkie. I not only sprinkle it over my bowl of pasta, I like to have additional nearby, to apply a fresh coat to the layers of pasta that follow. So you can imagine my shock to find that I liked this dish even more without the parmesan. The flavor of the sauce is so delicate, fresh and sweet that it needed nothing at all.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 x 28 ounce can tomatoes, whole peeled, San Marzano style if possible</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 tablespoons butter, unsalted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 onion, medium-sized yellow, peeled and halved</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">to taste salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound pasta</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Put the tomatoes, onion and butter in a heavy saucepan (it fit just right in a 3-quart) over medium heat. Bring the sauce to a simmer then lower the heat to keep the sauce at a slow, steady simmer for about 45 minutes, or until droplets of fat float free of the tomatoes. Stir occasionally, crushing the tomatoes against the side of the pot with a wooden spoon. Remove from heat, discard the onion, add salt to taste (you might find, as I did, that your tomatoes came salted and that you didn’t need to add more) and keep warm while you prepare your pasta.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Serve with spaghetti, with or without grated parmesan cheese to pass.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">* I liked this enough to make us more the next day, but I only had a can of tomato puree. It also worked well, despite having slightly less texture. You will need a little less simmering time as the tomatoes are already broken down.</span><br />
