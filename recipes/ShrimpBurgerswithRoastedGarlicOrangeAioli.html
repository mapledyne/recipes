	Author Notes: The roasted garlic-orange aioli plays double-duty here: it binds the shrimp burgers and serves as a perfect condiment slathered on a toasted bun. I've added caramelized fennel and shallots, along with red bell pepper, herbs, and orange zest, to the burgers to up the flavor and complement the aioli. Although these are a breeze to fry up in a cast iron skillet, they would be lovely grilled. - EmilyC (less) —EmilyC

Food52 Review: In summer, we say the more burgers, the better. This one provides a spunky break from beef, pork, and turkey, opting instead for fresh shrimp dotted with confetti-like accents of red pepper, fennel fronds and orange zest. In her accompanying aioli, EmilyC forgoes the wallop of a raw garlic and lemon for the mellow, floral flavors of roasted garlic and orange, and cleverly uses the aioli not once but twice: to bind the shrimp patty (we used 2 teaspoons, but you may want more), and to layer on just before biting down. Note: For the aioli's flavors to fully develop, we recommend making it the day before and letting it hang out in the fridge overnight, tightly covered. - A&M

<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon chives, finely chopped (reserving a bit for garnish)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon orange, zest from 1</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 pounds shrimp, peeled and deveined, finely chopped by hand</span><br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. To roast the garlic: Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Peel away the outer skin of 1 garlic head, and cut off top ¼ to ½ inch of the head to expose the individual cloves. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over the garlic head, wrap in foil, and roast for 30 to 35 minutes, or until cloves are soft when pressed. Cool, then squeeze the cloves from their skin. Mash 3 cloves and set aside -- reserve the rest for another use.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks. Gradually whisk in the remaining olive oil, then the grapeseed oil; begin with small drizzles, then whisk in a thin stream until the mayo is very thick. Whisk in a pinch of salt and then the orange juice, a little at a time (you may not need the full amount), orange zest and the roasted garlic paste. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. In a large sauté pan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Add the fennel and shallots and cook until they start to caramelize, about 8 minutes. Add the red bell pepper and cook about 3 minutes longer; you want the pepper to soften but retain its texture. Remove from the heat. Mix in the fennel fronds, chives, and orange zest.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. In a bowl, combine the shrimp with the sautéed vegetable-herb mixture and salt and pepper (to taste). Fold in aioli, a teaspoon at a time, to just bind the burgers. Form into four patties, and refrigerate until ready to cook.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in a pan (cast iron works well) over medium-high heat and fry the patties until golden, about 4 minutes on each side, or until cooked through.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Spread the aioli on both sides of the toasted buns; serve the shrimp burgers with your favorite condiments, such as a big leaf of butter crunch lettuce.</span><br />
