                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	I think a dish like this could have endless variations. You could infuse the milk, warming it, with a bay leaf or minced clove of garlic. You could stir chopped parsley into the sauce for color. If you don’t have dry mustard, you can add two teaspoons smooth Dijon or an English mustard to the sauce along with the cheese. You could sprinkle some plain breadcrumbs on top for extra crunch. Finally, I saw a version online in which the chefs had grilled pork sausages and sliced them up into the dish, baking them with the cheese sauce as well for more of a meal-in-one dish.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 medium head (about 2 to 2 1/4 pounds) cauliflower</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 tablespoons butter, unsalted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 tablespoons flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons mustard powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt, to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">black pepper, freshly ground, (or cayenne for zip)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups milk, whole is best but low-fat will probably work just fine</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons cheese, Cheddar, sharp, preferably English or Irish</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Chopped chives or flat-leaf parsley, for garnish (optional)</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat oven to 400 degrees.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Trim cauliflower and remove tough core. Cut into 1 to 2-inch florets. Steam (for about 10 minutes) or par-boil (6 to 7 minutes) florets until firm but tender. Drain, if needed, and spread florets on a towel so that it can wick out as much moisture as possible</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add flour and whisk to combine; cook for 1 minute to ensure you get rid of the floury taste. Add mustard powder and a pinch of cayenne or few grinds of black pepper, and stir to combine. Drizzle in milk in a thin, steady stream, whisking the whole time so that no lumps form. Season with salt and bring mixture to a simmer, stirring with a spoon; mixture should thicken. Stir in 1 1/4 cups cheddar, a handful at a time, letting each handful melt before adding the next. Taste sauce and adjust seasonings if needed.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Spread cauliflower florets in a 2-quart baking ovenproof baking dish. Spoon sauce over florets and sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons cheese. Bake until until bronzed and bubbly, about 30 minutes. For reference, if I wasn’t in such a rush to get dinner out on the table, I’d have baked mine a minute or two longer, up to 35 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Sprinkle with herbs, if desired. Eat with abandon.</span><br />
