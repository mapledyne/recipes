                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">9 ounces (~2 cups) flour, pastry</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2  teaspoon salt, kosher</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6.5 ounces butter, unsalted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 ounces water, cold</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cut the butter into 1 inch pieces and place in the fridge to chill.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Mix together the flour, salt and sugar. Dump onto a pastry board or countertop. Remove the butter from the fridge and, using a bench scraper, cut in half of the butter until it is in pieces the size of dimes, tossing it constantly with the flour. Cut in the rest of the butter until it is in pieces the size of nickels.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove the water from the fridge and in several batches, drizzle it only the flour and water mixture, tossing constantly with the bench scraper. Continue adding the water until it is moist enough to form a dough when you smash it together.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Pick up small chunks of the dough and use the heal of your hand to smear it onto your pastry board or countertop. After each smear, scrape up the dough with the bench scraper and toss it in a bowl. Continue until you have finished all of the dough.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place the dough on a sheet of plastic wrap and use the plastic to smash it into a disc shape (if making a double crust, split the dough in two), smoothing out the edges. Chill the dough in the fridge for at least an hour (ideally several hours) before rolling.</span><br />
