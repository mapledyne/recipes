                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	This fragrant soup brings Thai flavors – coconut, lemongrass and ginger – to a fresh, bright, versatile asparagus soup. It can easily be made vegetarian or vegan, works at any time of year (though it is especially great in the spring) and is both filling and healthy. We love to have it for lunch on a casual week day or for an appetizer for a fancy dinner. With a soup like this you just can't go wrong!

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 onion, large, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons butter, unsalted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 pounds asparagus, (after trimming an inch off the stalk)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon black pepper</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups coconut milk</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 cups broth, chicken or vegetable</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons lemongrass, finely minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons ginger, finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon lemon juice, fresh</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Cut asparagus into ½ inch pieces.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Cook onion in 3 tablespoons butter or oil in a 6-8 quart heavy pot over moderately low heat, stirring until softened, about 10 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Add lemongrass and ginger and continue cooking until vegetables are soft, about 3 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Add asparagus pieces, salt and pepper, then cook over medium heat, stirring frequently for about 5 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Add coconut milk and 5 cups of broth. Simmer, covered, until asparagus is very tender, about 15 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Puree soup in batches in a blender or with a immersion blender until smooth, transferring to a bowl after blending if using a blender since you will need to do it in several batches (use caution when blending hot liquids) and return to pot. If the soup is too thick, add up to another cup of broth, and cook for about five minutes, or until the soup is warm.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Add lemon juice, and serve with a garnish of chives or cilantro. (Soup may be prepared a day in advance. If making ahead, add the lemon juice after reheating.)</span><br />
