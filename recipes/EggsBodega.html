                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	Until Deb shared her “recipe” for these eggs, I figured you needed a full grill or a very particular type of bodega cat to make it—there just must be some trick that would keep bodegas cornering the egg sandwich market. I was wrong: It turns out you can make this entirely on your own following Deb’s hilariously low-effort recipe.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 eggs</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">a handful of cheese</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">to taste salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">pepper black, ground</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Whisk an egg or two with salt and pepper and a splash of water, spread the mixture out in a pan like a crêpe, and throw in some cheese (Deb uses sliced cheese, but I grate my own just because).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Wait a minute, fold the sides of the egg in to fit whatever bread you have on hand, wait another 30 seconds, and you’re done. Deb skips any extra vegetables or meat because this meal is “all about immediacy,” and I agree completely.</span><br />
