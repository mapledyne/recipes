                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	The lamb, however lean, is rich, packed with protein and nutrients and earthy in flavor. Lamb and herbs are both champions of spring and when combined into a burger and met with a hot grill it marks the intersection of spring and summer. Which, I might add, makes this a perfect contender for a Memorial Day BBQ. The burger is simply adorned with whipped feta (whipped with olive oil until creamy and light) peppery arugula, and a tomato seared over the grill to encourage sweetness and to create a texture that melts into the burger. This is the sort of burger that calls for a soft bun; a brioche or potato roll are both great contenders.

I do hope that your plans for this holiday weekend teeter more to the side of savoring than that of to-doing.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces feta</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 tablespoons olive oil, extra-virgin, divided</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound lamb, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup herbs, fresh (such as basil, mint, parsley, and dill), finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 garlic clove, minced</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 burger buns</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">for serving arugula</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Combine the feta and 3 tablespoons olive oil in a food processor and process until completely smooth, about 2 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a medium bowl combine the ground lamb, fresh herbs, garlic, kosher salt, and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Mix well.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Form into four 4 ounce patties.</span><br />
