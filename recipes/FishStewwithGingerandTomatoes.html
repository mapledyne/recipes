                <span itemprop="description">
	Use a Microplane or the smallest, finest holes on your cheese grater to grate the ginger.

Ginger is juicier and  less fibrous in spring, but you can use any fresh ginger you find.

As written, this recipe has you cook the potatoes and the sauce in separate pots so they cook at the same time, which gets dinner on the table sooner. If you'd prefer to cut down on the number of dirty pots instead, you can cook the potatoes and sauce in the same pot: Cook the potatoes first (in a steamer basket with some water in the bottom of the pot and the lid tightly on), then remove the potatoes, pour out the water, and make the sauce.
