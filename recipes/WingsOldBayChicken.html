                <span itemprop="description">
	What’s a Super Bowl without wings? In this chicken wing recipe we are seasoning the wings with Old Bay, a favorite spice blend for crab which works just as well with chicken.

The wings are tossed with in a sauce make with Old Bay, butter, and lemon juice, then baked, broiled, and served with cocktail sauce.

Yes, serving cocktail sauce with chicken wings is a little weird, but it’s good! Especially with the Old Bay.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 pounds wings, chicken, separated tips from drummettes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 Tbsp (1/2 cup or 1 stick) butter, unsalted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 Tbsp seasoning, Old Bay, plus more for dusting</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 Tbsp lemon juice</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Cocktail sauce for dipping, (optional)</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Preheat the oven to 425°F. Allow the wings to come to room temperature (or else the sauce will be more difficult to spread on them). Pat the chicken wings dry.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Make Old Bay sauce: Melt the butter in a small pot and whisk in the Old Bay and lemon juice. Let it cool enough to feel lukewarm.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Mix the sauce again and toss the chicken wings in half the sauce.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Bake: Arrange the wings in one layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, aluminum foil, or Silpat and bake at 425°F for 25 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Broil: Take the wings out of the oven and turn on the broiler. Set a rack about 6 inches under the broiler. Turn the wings over on the baking sheet and put under the broiler for 3-4 minutes, or until they are nicely browned.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. To serve, toss in the remaining sauce and set on a plate. Dust with more Old Bay and serve with your favorite cocktail sauce.</span><br />
