                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	Instead of 1 cup half-and-half, you could use 1/2 cup milk + 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1/2 cup heavy cream + 1/2 cup additional stock or broth. I like to use both broccoli florets and stems when I cook, and I find that the stems cook up with the best texture and at the same rate as the florets when I peel them first. I did so here.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 tablespoons butter, unsalted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 small onion, chopped small</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 garlic clove, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup cream, half-and-half</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 cups vegetable or chicken broth, low-sodium</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 bay leaf</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/4 pounds broccoli or 4 cups broccoli florets and stems, chopped small</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 large carrot (about 6 ounces) or 2 slim ones, chopped tiny (1 cup)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces (about 2 1/2 cups) cheese, Cheddar, sharp, , coarsely grated plus a pinch extra for garnish</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Melt the butter in a large, heavy pot over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until tender, about 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the flour and cook until golden, 3 to 4 minutes, then gradually whisk in the half-and-half until smooth. Add the chicken broth, bay leaf, salt and pepper and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add the broccoli and carrot to the broth mixture and simmer until tender, about 15 to 20 minutes. Discard the bay leaf and adjust seasoning if needed, but err on the cautious side with the salt because the cheese will add a bit. Puree the soup to your desired texture — I like mine fairly chunky, just lightly blended — with an immersion blender or in an upright one. Back on the stove, add cheese and whisk until melted, about 1 minute.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Serve in bowls, garnished with a pinch of cheese. We like a hearty slice of grainy toasted bread on the side, for swiping.</span><br />
