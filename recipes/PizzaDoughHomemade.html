                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	If you aren’t one for breaking out the thermometer to check the water temperature for the dough, just put the very tip of your finger in the warm water, if it begins to burn after a few seconds, it’s too hot, but if it’s not warm to the touch, it’s not quite warm enough. You want to make sure you start off with the correct water temperature, or else the yeast will not bloom, and you will have to start over. 

So if you want to make this using whole wheat flour you need to add Vital Gluten to your flour or use half All purpose or half bread flour with your half whole wheat flour. For non experienced bread makers, I suggest not pre warming your oven to 200 degrees. Yeast dies at 139 degrees and your dough will not die if you put it in a hot oven. 80 degrees is all that is needed to bulk ferment your dough. When punching down your dough it means to fold your dough to release the gas not to actually throw a fist into the dough. When you do roll your dough out if it keeps bouncing back and won't stretch let your dough relax a few minutes then go back to rolling your dough. You will want to dock your dough (prick with fork) before placing in the oven so that it does not puff up. The dough should be baked at 400 degree oven until crisp or golden brown about 8 - 12 mins. Then take out add your toppings and place back into the oven to melt cheese.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups warm water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 1/2 teaspoons (2 packets) yeast, rapid rise</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons sugar, granulated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 tablespoons olive oil, extra-virgin, plus more for greasing bowl</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons salt, kosher</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 cups flour, all-purpose, plus more for dusting</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Preheat the oven to 200º F. Once the oven has preheated, immediately turn the oven off.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Combine water, yeast and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a hook attachment. Gently stir to dissolve the yeast. Let the yeast bloom for 5 to 10 minutes (once the top of the mixture begins to get foamy from one side of the bowl to the other, I know it’s done). On the lowest speed, turn on the mixer and add olive oil and salt. Slowly add in the flour (I usually add half the flour, let it incorporate slightly, then pour in the other half.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Increase to medium speed and mix the dough until it begins to form a ball and wrap itself around the hook, this step should take about 2 minutes. Allow the mixer to knead the dough for another 5 to 8 minutes. Make sure the dough is smooth and elastic.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Form the dough into a ball and place into a large bowl coated with olive oil. Flip the dough in the oil a few times to make sure the dough is evenly coated. Cover the dough with a tea towel to discourage a skin forming on the dough. Let the dough rise for 1 hour in the warm oven.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Once the dough has risen and doubled in size, punch down and cut into 8 equal-sized pieces (or cut the dough in half for 2 large pizzas, which serves 6 to 8 people total.) Use the dough immediately or freeze up to 3 months.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. To Freeze: Whenever the dough has finished rising, cut the dough into 8 equal pieces (each piece is 1 serving), wrap each piece in cling wrap and stack the covered pieces of dough into a labeled gallon-sized freezer bag. The dough will stay good for 3 months. When ready to use just take out however many individual balls of dough that you may need and let them come to room temperature for 2 to 3 hours on the counter.</span><br />
