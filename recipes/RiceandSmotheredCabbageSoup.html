                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 small yellow onion, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup (120 ml) olive oil, extra virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 (~2-pound / 1 kg) Savoy cabbage, quartered, cored, and very thinly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 or 3 large garlic cloves, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Freshly ground black pepper</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tbsp white or red wine vinegar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups (475 ml) chicken or beef broth</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (175 grams) water, and maybe more</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2/3 cup (about 135 grams) Arborio rice</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tbsp (28 grams) unsalted butter</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">About 1/3 cup (roughly 1 heaping handful) freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Freshly ground black pepper</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Put the onion and olive oil in a Dutch oven (or another pot of approximately the same size), and set over medium heat. Cook and stir until the onion is pale gold, and then add the garlic. Continue cooking until the garlic is fragrant and looks cooked through, a few minutes, and then add the sliced cabbage. Stir a few times to coat the cabbage with oil; then continue to cook until itâ€™s wilted. Add a couple of generous pinches of salt, a grind or two of pepper, and the vinegar. Stir to mix, and then cover the pan and reduce the heat to the lowest setting. Cook, stirring occasionally, for at least 1.5 hours, or until the cabbage is very, very tender. If the pan seems dry at any point, you can add a tablespoon or two of water. When the cabbage is done, taste for salt, and season as needed.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">This cabbage can be made a few days ahead of the soup, if needed, and it also freezes nicely.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a good-size pot (about 4 quarts), combine the cabbage, the broth, and 1 cup of water, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir in the rice, and then lower the heat so that the soup bubbles at a slow but steady simmer. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the rice is tender but firm to the bite, about 20 minutes. If you find that the soup is becoming too thick, add a little water. The soup should be pretty dense, but there should still be some liquid.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">When the rice is done, turn off the heat, and stir in the butter and the grated Parmesan. Taste, and correct for salt. Serve with black pepper and more Parmesan.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Yield: 4 to 6 servings - and try to save some for later, because these leftovers make a lunch worth looking forward to.</span><br />
