                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">18 black olives, jumbo, pitted, pitted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, whipped - herb or ranch, softened</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">18 black olives, small, pitted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 carrot</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 can red peppers, roasted or pimentos</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Cut a slit from top to bottom, lengthwise, into the side of each jumbo olive. Carefully insert about 1 teaspoon of cream cheese into each olive. Slice the carrot into eighteen 1/4 inch thick rounds; cut a small notch out of each carrot slice to form feet. Save the cut out piece and press into center of small olive to form the beak. If necessary cut a small slit into each olive before inserting the beak.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Set a big olive, large hole side down, onto a carrot slice. Then, set a small olive onto the large olive, adjusting so that the beak, cream cheese chest and notch in the carrot slice line up. Secure with a toothpick.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. (Optional) Cut and wrap scarves using pimentos.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Gets folks laughing! Worth the effort. Tips (from me & others):</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">use herbed or ranch flavored whipped cream cheese (it will still look white);</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">don't simply slice the olive, remove a small section to accommodate the filling;</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">pipe whipped cream cheese using a sandwich bag;</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">make "beaks" thin to avoid splitting the "head" while inserting them; try inserting "beaks" vertically rather than horizontally;</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">"heads" take the most time - make them the night before and leave them soaking in the olive brine.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Don't forget to make baby penguins! Fill a single olive & set on top of carrot feet with large whole facing up. Insert toothpick through center to pin it to the "feet". Set "beak" into cream cheese filling of large whole - it will hold it in place. Do a variation on this to make "swimming" penguins. Fill a single olive. Stick beak in one end and feet in the other. Shave off a small portion from the underside of the olive to keep it from rolling around.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">For "environment" we used an aluminum pizza pan and foam board ($1.99)for an ice flow. Trace the pan on the foam board. Cut out the circle with a craft knife. Cut circle in half jaggedly to simulate ice flow. Cut remaining half into pieces; glue and stack in layers to create "hills". Cover pizza pan with blue plastic wrap. Place "ice flow" into the pizza pan. Tape plastic wrap to bottom of the pan to hold it in place. When placing penguins, push the toothpick into the foam board to hold them in place. Transports easily this way.</span><br />
