                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/4 cups lentils, red split (masoor dal), picked over washed and drained</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 cups water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon turmeric, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 tablespoons vegetable oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon cumin seeds</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 to 4 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 medium onion, peeled and cut into fine slices</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 pound cabbage, cored and finely shredded</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 - 2 chilies, red, fresh, medium, finely sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 teaspoons salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 medium tomato, finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon peeled, finely grated fresh ginger</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Put the lentils and water into a heavy pot and bring to a boil. Remove any scum that collects at the top. Add the turmeric and stir to mix. Cover, leaving the lid very slightly ajar, turn heat down to low, and simmer gently for 1 1/4 hours. Stir a few times during the last 30 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">When the lentils cook, heat the oil in an 8 to 9 inch frying pan over medium heat. When hot, put in the cumin seeds. Let them sizzle for 3 to 4 seconds. Now put in the garlic. As soon as the garlic pieces begin to brown, put in the onion, cabbage and green chilies. Stir and fry the cabbage mixture for about 10 minutes or until it begins to brown and turn slightly crisp. Stir in 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Turn off the heat under the frying pan.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">When the lentils have cooked for 1 1/4 hours, add the remaining 1 1/4 teaspoon salt, the tomato and ginger to the pot. Stir to mix. Cover and cook another 10 minutes. Add the cabbage mixture and any remaining oil in the frying pan. Stir to mix and bring to a simmer.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Simmer uncovered for 2 to 3 minutes or until the cabbage is heated through.</span><br />
