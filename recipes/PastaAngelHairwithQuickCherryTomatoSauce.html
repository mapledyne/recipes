                <span itemprop="description">
	If you're good at multitasking, start the sauce as soon as the pasta goes into the pot so everything comes together at about the same time. If this feels stressful, cook the pasta first and then start the sauce. Either way, dinner is ready fast!

For a fancier presentation, if serving this at a dinner party, remove half of the tomatoes before tossing with the pasta. Plate the pasta, then top with the reserved tomatoes.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 1/2 teaspoons salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pounds pasta, angel hair, or another thin spaghetti</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 tablespoons olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 pints tomatoes, red and yellow cherry</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, crushed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cloves garlic, very thinly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup basil leaves, fresh, removed from the stems</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup Parmesan cheese, grated</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of water with 2 teaspoons of salt to a boil. Add the pasta and stir well until the water returns to a boil.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the pasta is tender. With a ladle or a heat-proof liquid measuring cup, remove about 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water and set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Drain the pasta but do not rinse it; transfer to a bowl. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the oil and toss well.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Prep the tomatoes: Pierce small whole tomatoes with a skewer or the tip of a paring knife. Halve the tomatoes if they’re large.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Make the sauce: In a deep skillet over medium-high heat, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil. Add the cherry tomatoes – they will splutter – along with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, red pepper, and black pepper.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cook, shaking the pan, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the tomatoes start to collapse and form juices. Add the garlic and continue cooking for 2 minutes more.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Toss the pasta with the sauce: Add the pasta and 1/4 cup of the pasta water to the skillet with the tomato sauce. Toss well.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add more pasta water if needed, a tablespoon at a time, to thin the mixture so the sauce coats the pasta. Add half the basil leaves and toss again.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Serve: Divide the pasta among 4 to 6 large bowls. Add a few basil leaves on top of the pasta and sprinkle generously with Parmesan.</span><br />
