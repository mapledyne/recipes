                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	This soup is built on a mushroom preparation I’ve had in my arsenal for years, a combination of dried and fresh mushrooms cooked down with seasonings until they are soft and coated in a silky glaze. I usually use this mixture to sauce pasta or top crostini, but I decided to soup-ify it by combining it with a shiitake and Parmesan broth, which came together while I was cooking down the mushrooms. I always save and freeze Parmesan rinds, shiitake stems, and leek tops, and I figured the combination would produce a broth that would complement and enhance the mushrooms’ earthy flavor. We loved this soup in its more rustic form (unblended), but for fun I also decided to press some through a fine mesh strainer to make it smoother. I poured that batch into shot glasses, which would be a great way to serve it as a first course or at a holiday gathering.

<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 cups water</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup wild mushrooms, dried mixed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup water, boiling</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound mushrooms, cremini or white button</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 ounce mushrooms, wild, such as shiitake, oyster, maitake, chanterelles, etc.</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons butter, unsalted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons olive oil, extra-virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup shallot or onion, diced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt, Kosher or sea</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon tomato paste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup vermouth, sweet red</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 cups broth, Parmesan-shiitake or prepared vegetable or mushroom stock</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon vinegar, sherry</span><br />

                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Combine all ingredients in a heavy-bottomed pot and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce the heat, then simmer for about 45 minutes. Remove the solids from the broth (use your fingers or a utensil, or strain the broth through a sieve) and discard. Use broth immediately, or cool and refrigerate (for up to 1 week) or freeze (for up to several months) for future use.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Soak the dried mushrooms in the boiling water until they are soft. Lift the softened mushrooms from the liquid and gently squeeze them out, reserving the soaking liquid. Strain the liquid through a coffee filter to remove any grit, and set the soaking liquid aside. Roughly chop the softened mushrooms and set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Remove any soil or dirt from the fresh mushrooms with a soft brush or cloth. Trim the bottoms of the cremini or button mushrooms and slice them lengthwise. If using shiitakes, remove the stems and slice the caps. If using oyster, maitake, or chanterelles, gently tear them into small pieces.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Combine the butter and olive oil in a very large wide skillet over medium heat until the butter is melted. Add the shallot and a pinch of salt and cook until softened and translucent.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Add the softened dried mushrooms and stir well to coat them with the butter and oil. Cook for a few minutes, add the fresh mushrooms and another pinch of salt, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring to coat them with oil.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Allow the fresh mushrooms to cook over medium heat, uncovered, until they are soft, shrinking, and beginning to brown.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Clear a spot in the bottom of the skillet and add the tomato paste, allowing it to cook for a minute or two before stirring it through the mushrooms.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">8. Continue to cook until the mushrooms are browned at the edges, then add the vermouth, stirring through and scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">9. When most of the liquid has evaporated, add the reserved mushroom soaking liquid. Cook down until the mushrooms are glazed with the reduced liquid, stirring occasionally.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">10. Heat the broth in a large, heavy-bottomed pot and add the mushroom mixture to the hot broth. Purée with an immersion blender or in a blender or food processor until smooth.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">11. Add the sherry vinegar and thyme and stir through. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.</span><br />
