                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Warm the oil in a covered soup pot on medium-low heat, add the onions, celery, and salt and cook until very soft but not browned, about 10 minutes. Add the potatoes and water, stir well, and bring to a boil.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add the dill and cream cheese. Working in patches in a blender, puree the soup until smooth. Season with the black pepper and more salt to taste. Gently reheat.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Top each bowl of soup with chives and parsley, if you like.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Variations:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Potato-Cheese Soup:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add some minced or pressed garlic with the onions and celery. After 5 minutes, add 1 cup of finely chopped carrots and cook for 10 minutes, or until the carrots have softened. Then add the potatoes and water. Include the dill, or don't. Stir in 1 packed cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese along with the cream cheese. Puree the soup.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Potato Florentine Soup</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add 2 teaspoons of finely chopped fresh rosemary with the onions and celery and omit the dill. Add 1 packed cup of shredded Fontina cheese of 1/2 cup of shredded Parmesan cheese with the cream cheese. Puree the soup, return to the pot, and reheat until hot. Stir in 10 to 12 ounces of rinsed, stemmed, and finely chopped fresh spinach (about 7 cups chopped), and cook for a couple of minutes until the spinach has wilted but is still bright green.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Potato-Cabbage soup:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">After the onions and celery have cooked for 8 minutes, stir in 1 teaspoon of ground caraway seeds and 4 cups of chopped cabbage. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 15 minutes, or until the cabbage is soft. Continue with the basic recipe. If you like, add about 1 cup of shredded cheddar. Serve chunky or pureed.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Vichyssoise:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Reduce the onions to 1 cup and add about 4 cups of chopped leeks. Reduce the quantity of potatoes to 3 cups, and peel them for a pristine soup and to allow the flavor of the leeks to shine. Replace the dill with 1 tablespoon of chopped fresh taragon. Replace the cream cheese with 1 cup of half-and-half. Continue with the basic recipe.</span><br />
