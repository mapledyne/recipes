                <span itemprop="description">
	Put the chicken in a large soup pot or Dutch oven, breast side up. Add the rest of the ingredients to the pot, pouring in the water last to avoid splashing. Cover the pot and place it on the stove over medium heat.

When the soup comes to a boil, turn it down to low and simmer, covered, until the chicken is tender and the meat is just beginning to come away from the bones, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Continue with the remaining steps as described in the recipe below.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 3- to 4-pound chicken, or an equivalent mix of bone-in thighs, legs, or breast meat</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 celery ribs, sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 carrots, medium, peeled and sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 parsnip, medium, halved lengthwise and sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 onion, medium yellow, diced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cloves garlic, smashed and peeled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 sprigs parsley, flat-leaf, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 large sprigs thyme, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 teaspoons salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 quarts water</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Put the chicken in the pot of a pressure cooker, breast side up.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Layer all of the other ingredients into the pot, pouring in the water last to avoid splashing. Adding four teaspoons of salt at this point will result in a well-seasoned soup broth. Use less salt or eliminate if you'd like to make basic chicken broth to use for other purposes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Cook the soup: Place the lid on the pressure cooker. Make sure the pressure regulator is set to the “Sealing” position. Select the “Manual” program, then set the time to 25 minutes at high pressure. (Instant Pot users can also select the "Soup" program and follow the same cooking time. For stovetop pressure cookers, cook at high pressure for 22 minutes.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">It will take about 35 minutes for your pressure cooker to come up to pressure, and then the actual cooking will begin. Total time from the time you seal the pressure cooker to the finished dish is about one hour.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. When the soup has finished cooking, wait about 15 minutes before "quick" releasing the pressure. This helps prevent a lot of steamy broth spitting out of the valve. You can also cover the valve with a kitchen towel while it vents to help disperse the steam.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Prepare the chicken meat: Use a pair of tongs or a slotted spoon to remove the chicken from the pot, and transfer it to a dish to cool until you can comfortably handle it, about 20 minutes. It may come apart as you are removing it from the pot, so go slowly and carefully.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Take the meat off of the bones, and discard the bones, skin, and cartilage. Cut or tear the meat into bite-sized pieces.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6 Stir the chicken meat back into the soup. Ladle into bowls and serve.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Let any leftover soup cool completely, then store in the fridge for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 3 months. The soup may gel as it cools; it will liquefy again when heated.</span><br />
