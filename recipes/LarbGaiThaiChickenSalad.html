                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	This recipe is inspired by the Larb Gai at Summer Summer Thai Eatery in Emeryville, California. I ate it nearly every day for lunch for about 2 weeks, and I never tired of it—it was fresh, light, and satisfying. Summer Summer's larb is seasoned with toasted rice powder, which is so good, though I haven't missed it in my homemade larb—the herbs, shallots, scallions, and lime dressing provide plenty of flavor. I've been serving it as they do at Summer Summer (and many other Thai eateries) with steamed brown rice and lettuce leaves on the side. 

Recipe adapted from this Bon Appétit recipe.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound chicken, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup lime juice, fresh, from about 2 limes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons + 2 teaspoons fish sauce</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 teaspoons sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup scallions, thinly sliced (need about 16 slices)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 cup shallots, thinly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon hot chili such as Thai bird, Serrano, thinly sliced or jalapeño or more to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup cilantro, fresh, roughly chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup mint leaves, fresh, finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">cups lettuce, romaine, Little Gem or Boston</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">rice, Steamed, for serving</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Place the chicken and 1/4 cup water in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally to break up any clumps of meat, until the chicken is cooked through, about 8 minutes—you don’t want to brown the chicken, so lower heat as needed.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Meanwhile, stir together the lime juice, fish sauce, and sugar in a small bowl, until the sugar is dissolved. Set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Add scallions, shallots, and chili to skillet, and cook over low heat just until the vegetables are tender and most of the liquid has evaporated, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in the sauce, cilantro, and mint, and toss to coat.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Serve the larb with the lettuce leaves and rice on the side.</span><br />
