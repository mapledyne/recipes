                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	I have fond memories of eating pancakes as a kid. As an adult, I'm terribly picky about them, not to mention more easily thrown into a stupor after carb-overloading. But at the resort my family often goes to over Christmas, there are amazing, enticing pancakes, and those I'm unable to resist. They are unusual, ricotta pancakes cooked thin and dense, and served with passion fruit syrup and a pool of butter. At home, I'm more likely to have yogurt in the fridge than ricotta. I happened to have been given a pomegranate as a gift recently, and I subbed that for the passion fruit--if you don't have one, add berries, bananas, or sauteed apples. Since these pancakes are light on the flour (actually, sort of light on ingredients in general), the end result is airy, not-too-sweet, and satisfying. 

When making pancakes that rely on yogurt you can skip the egg white beating step and add 1/2 tsp of baking powder and 1/4 tsp of baking soda (per cup of flour) and get very very fluffy, very tangy pancakes.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg white</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup yogurt, plain, low- or non-fat is fine</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons flour</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pinch salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon butter</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup pomegranate seeds</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">maple syrup, warmed, for serving</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Separate the egg. Combine the 1 egg yolk in a small bowl with the yogurt, flour, and vanilla extract. Stir well with a fork.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. In a larger bowl, beat the 2 egg whites, sugar, and salt until they are fluffy and hold a soft peak.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Scrape about a third of the egg whites into the egg yolk-yogurt mixtures and stir to lighten. Very gently, fold in the rest of the egg whites, trying not to deflate them.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Melt the butter in a small nonstick pan over medium-low heat. When the pan is hot, add half of the batter. Cook 3-4 minutes, until brown, then flip and cook 3-4 minutes on the reverse side. Repeat with the remainder of the batter.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Top with pomegranate seeds, syrup, and a thin slice of butter. Serve with syrup.</span><br />
