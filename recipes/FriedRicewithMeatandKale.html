                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 bunch kale, lacinato</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons oil, peanut or grapefruit</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">to taste sea salt, fine grain</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons lemon juice, fresh, or to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 cups rice, cooked (leftover from takeout is awesome), cold</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 ounces pork, pulled, smoked or similar other meat</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon fish sauce, or more as needed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">optional for garnish butter, unsalted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">optional ginger, fresh</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Wash and dry the kale leaves. Trim away and discard their woody stems, and then chop or tear the leaves into bit-sized pieces.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat a wok or large 12 inch heavy skillet over high heat. When the pan is hot enough for a drop of water to instantly evaporate, add 1 tablespoon of the oil. Add the kale and stir to coat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the kale is wilted and beginning to char at the edges, 1 to 3 minutes. Optionally add ginger if the meat you are using is a bit bland. Add a good pinch of salt; then taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. Scrape the kale into a bowl, add 1 teaspoon of the lemon juice, and toss to mix.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">With the wok still over high heat, add the rice, and then immediately add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, drizzling it down the sides of the wok. Stir to coat the rice with the oil. Then spread the rice all around the wok so that as much of it touches the hot surface as possible, and let it cook - untouched, for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Continue to cook until the rice is evenly hot and browned to your liking. Then add the meat and the 1 tablespoon fish sauce, stirring well. Continue to cook until the meat is heated through; then stir in the kale. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, and toss well.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Taste for seasoning. If the rice is lacking salt - add more fish sauce, about 1/2 teaspoon at a time. If the flavor is a little flat, try adding 1 additional teaspoon of lemon juice. If you meat is on the lean side and you find that the rice tastes dry, adding even 1/2 tablespoon of butter can work wonders.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Transfer the rice to a serving dish, taking care to scrape up any tasty browned bits that stick to the wok. Serve immediately.</span><br />
