                <span itemprop="description">
	If there is one thing you can count on during the summer, it’s zucchini, and plenty of it!

These cheesy little zucchini bites are a great way to put all that zucchini to use. They’re like tater tots, but made with zucchini, in a mini muffin pan. They’re sort of a riff off our broccoli cheddar bites, and like their broccoli cousins, are perfect for breakfast, a quick snack, or a school lunch.

A touch of rosemary with some lemon zest with cheddar cheese and Parmesan work great with the zucchini. The lemon and rosemary are just enough to make these bites interesting, but not so much as to overwhelm.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 pounds zucchini, grated (large holes of a box grater)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup mayonnaise</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 eggs</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 cups fresh bread, diced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup minced green onions</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cloves garlic, minced, about 2 teaspoons</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 teaspoons lemon zest, grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon rosemary, fresh, minced fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup cheddar cheese, grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup cheese, Parmesan, grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon pepper, black , freshly ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2  teaspoons olive oil to coat mini muffin tins</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Salt and drain the zucchini: Toss the grated zucchini with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and place in a colander to drain (in a sink or over a bowl). Let drain for 30 minutes to an hour.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">After at least 30 minutes, use your (clean) hands to press and squeeze the grated zucchini against the colander to release more moisture.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Then use double layered sturdy paper towels or a clean tea towel to wrap up the zucchini and squeeze out even more moisture.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Whisk together the mayo and eggs, then whisk in the bread, green onions, garlic, zest, rosemary, cheeses, pepper: While the zucchini is draining in step 1, whisk together in a large bowl the mayonnaise and eggs until smooth.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Then add the bread, green onions, garlic, lemon zest, rosemary, grated cheddar, Parmesan, and black pepper. Let that sit while the zucchini is draining so that the bread breaks down in the mixture.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Prepare pans, preheat oven: Grease the wells of 2 mini-muffin tins with olive oil. Preheat the oven to 350°F.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Stir zucchini into batter, spoon into mini-muffin tins: Stir the drained, squeezed zucchini into the egg mixture until evenly distributed. Spoon the mixture into the wells of the mini-muffin tins, about a heaping tablespoon each.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Bake for 25 minutes at 350°F.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Cool and release zucchini bites from pan: Let cool for 5 minutes, then run a knife around the edges of the zucchini bites to loosen them from the pan. Remove from the pan to a rack to cool further.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Eat warm or cool to room temp, then chill or freeze to reheat later.</span><br />
