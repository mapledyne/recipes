                <span itemprop="description">
	Well-seasoned grilled or broiled kebabs will make anyone a convert to dark-meat chicken. You can use chicken breasts here too, but watch them closely so they don’t overcook and dry out.
 
Other protein you can use: turkey thighs; pork or veal shoulder, steak, or loin; sturdy fish like swordfish or salmon

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">About 11/2 pounds boneless chicken thighs or legs, cut into 11/2-inch chunks</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 onions, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons olive oil, extra virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 lemon, juice of</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon garlic, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">black pepper, freshly ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 bay leaves, crumbled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon marjoram or oregano leaves, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon oregano, dried</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Lemon wedges or ground sumac (available in Middle Eastern stores)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 skewers, wood</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1.If you’re using wooden skewers (you’ll need at least 8), soak them in warm water while you prepare the chicken. When you’re ready to cook—if you choose not to marinate the meat—heat a charcoal or gas grill or the broiler to moderate heat and put the rack about 4 inches from the heat source.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2.For the marinade, chop one of the onions and combine it in a large bowl with the oil, lemon juice, garlic, some salt and pepper, the bay leaves, and the marjoram; taste and adjust the seasoning. Marinate the chicken in this mixture for at least a few minutes or an hour or so at room temperature or longer—even overnight—in the refrigerator.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3.Cut the remaining onion into quarters, then separate it into large pieces. Thread the chicken and onion alternately onto skewers, leaving a little space between pieces.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4.Broil or grill, turning once or twice, until the chicken is cooked through, 12 to 15 minutes (to check for doneness, cut into a piece with a thin-bladed knife; the center should be white or slightly pink). Serve with the lemon wedges or sprinkle with a bit of sumac.</span><br />
