                <span itemprop="description">
	If you don't have a grill you can use a well-seasoned grill pan or a large cast iron pan on the stove-top. Heat on high to sear and then lower the heat to finish cooking. Make sure to use your stove vent, searing the steak this way can smoke up the kitchen!

If you want, before adding the steak to the marinade, reserve a couple tablespoons of the marinade to drizzle over the finished carne asada to serve.

<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 Tbsp sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon cumin seed, ground (if have whole, toast and then grind)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 garlic cloves, minced (4 teaspoons)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 chile pepper, jalapeño, seeded and minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 bunch cilantro, fresh, leaves and stems, finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">avocado, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">wedges lime</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">tortillas, Corn or flour</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">radishes, thinly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">lettuce, thinly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salsa, Pico de gallo</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Marinate the steak: Whisk to combine the olive oil, soy sauce, lime juice, vinegar, sugar, black pepper, and cumin in a large, non-reactive bowl or baking dish. Stir in the minced garlic, jalapeño, and cilantro.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place the steak in the marinade and turn over a couple of times to coat thoroughly.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1-4 hours or overnight (if using flank steak marinate at least 3 hours).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Preheat grill: Preheat your grill for high direct heat, with part of the grill reserved with fewer coals (or gas flame) for low, indirect heat. You'll know the grill is hot enough when you can hold your hand above the grill grates for no more than one second.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Sear steak on hot side of grill: Remove the steak from the marinade. Lightly brush off most of the bits of cilantro and garlic (do not brush off the oil).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place on the hot side of the grill. Grill the steak for a few minutes only, until well seared on one side (the browning and the searing makes for great flavor), then turn the steak over and sear on the other side.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Move steak to cool side of grill: Once both sides are well seared, move the steak to the cool side of the grill, with any thicker end of the steak nearer to the hot side of the grill.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Test with a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the steak, or use your fingers (see The Finger Test to Check the Doneness of Meat). Pull the meat off the grill at 115°F to 120°F for rare, 125°F medium rare, 140°F for medium. The meat will continue to cook in its residual heat.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Note that lean flank steak is best cooked rare, while skirt steak can be cooked well without losing moisture or flavor because it has more fat marbling.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Tent with foil and let rest: Place the steak on a cutting board, tent with foil and let rest for 10 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Slice steak across the grain of the meat: Use a sharp, long bladed knife (a bread knife works great for slicing meat) to cut the meat. Notice the direction of the grain of the meat and cut perpendicular to the grain. Angle your knife so that your slices are wide and thin.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. (Optional) Serve with grill toasted tortillas: Warm the tortillas (corn or flour) for 30 seconds on each side in a dry skillet or on the grill, until toasty and pliable. Alternatively, you can warm tortillas in a microwave: heating just one or two at a time, place tortillas on a paper towel and microwave them for 15 to 20 seconds each on high.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">(Optional) Serve with pico de gallo (fresh tomato salsa) and chopped avocados.</span><br />
