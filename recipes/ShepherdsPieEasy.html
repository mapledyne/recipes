                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 to 2 pounds potatoes, peeled and quartered</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 Tablespoons butter</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 onion, medium, chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup corn, frozen</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 lb beef, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 squirt ketchup</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt, pepper, other seasonings of choice</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Boil the potatoes: Place the peeled and quartered potatoes in medium sized pot. Cover with at least an inch of cold water. Add a teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until tender (about 20 minutes).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Sauté the onion: While the potatoes are cooking, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large sauté pan on medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook until tender, about 6 to 10 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">If you are including vegetables, add them according to their cooking time. Carrots should be cooked with the onions, because they take as long to cook as the onions do.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Add ground beef to the pan with the onions. Cook until no longer pink. Season with Worcestershire, ketchup salt and pepper.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">If you are including peas or corn, add them toward the end of the cooking of the onions, or after the meat starts to cook, as they take very little cooking time.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Mash the cooked potatoes: When the potatoes are done cooking (a fork can easily pierce), remove them from the pot and place them in a bowl with the remaining 4 Tbsp of butter. Mash with a fork or potato masher, and season with salt and pepper to taste.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Layer the meat mixture and mashed potatoes in a casserole dish: Preheat oven to 400°F. Spread the beef, onions, and vegetables (if using) in an even layer in a large baking dish (9 x 9 casserole).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Spread the mashed potatoes over the top of the ground beef. Rough up the surface of the mashed potatoes with a fork so there are peaks that will get well browned. You can even use a fork to make creative designs in the mashed potatoes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Bake in oven: Place in a 400°F oven and cook until browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes. If necessary, broil for the last few minutes to help the surface of the mashed potatoes brown.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Suggested variation:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Sprinkle grated cheddar cheese over the top of the mashed potatoes before baking.</span><br />
