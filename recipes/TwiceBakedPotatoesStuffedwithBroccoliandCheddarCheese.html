                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 large potatoes, russet</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">kosher salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup broccoli, cooked, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons crème fraîche or sour cream</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons butter, unsalted, softened</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 cup cheddar, grated sharp</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">black pepper, freshly ground</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Heat the oven to 450° F and position a rack in the middle of the oven.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Scrub the potatoes well, then rinse and dry them. Rub the skins with a little olive oil and sprinkle all over with salt. Poke several holes in the potatoes, using a fork with sharp tines. Put the potatoes directly on the oven rack and bake until completely tender, 45 to 60 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Remove the potatoes from the oven, and being careful not to burn your fingers, split them down the middle with a sharp knife. Scoop the insides of the potato into a bowl, leaving the skins intact. Mash in the broccoli, creme fraiche, 1 tablespoon of the butter, 1/2 cup of the cheddar, and salt and pepper to taste.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Pile this mixture into the skins and transfer the potato halves to a baking sheet. Dot the tops of the potatoes with the remaining tablespoon of butter and sprinkle evenly with the rest of the cheese. Bake for a second time until golden, 10 to 15 minutes. (If you want to turn on the broiler for the last few minutes to get the tops nice and brown, I say go for it.)</span><br />
