During Delancey's gestation, and for a long time after it opened, we ate a lot of takeout. One of our favorite quick, cheap lunches was (and still is) a Vietnamese rice noodle salad called bun, and we like it enough that now, sometimes, we even make our own version at home. Don't be put off by the number of steps. The dressing, a take on nuoc cham, can be made a few days ahead, and if you've got the ingredients on hand and the dressing prepared, you can bang this meal out in very little time. 

This salad is wide open to adaptations and a great vehicle for using up leftovers or odds and ends. Take the recipe and run with it, using whatever vegetables and cooked meats you have on hand. 

(And though it changes the whole concept, try substituting hot freshly cooked rice for the noodles. We do that often. I like to use Calrose, an inexpensive Japanese-style medium-grain rice that's grown in California and commonly sold in Asian grocery stores.)

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons fish sauce</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons lime juice, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 - 3 tablespoons sugar, brown</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 garlic, clove</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 chili, thai, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces noodles, rice, thin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 - 4 leaves cabbage, napa, thinly sliced crosswise</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 medium carrots, shredded or cut into matchsticks</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cucumber, english, halved and thinly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">handful of herbs, fresh such as basil, mint and cilantro</span><br />

                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">To make the dressing:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a jar or small bowl, combine dressing ingredients and mix well. Taste. If it's too pungent add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time. If you'd like more sweetness, add more brown sugar 1/2 tablespoon at a time. Remember that you're going to be putting this dressing on unsalted vegetables and noodles so you want the dressing to have a lot of flavor, but it shouldn't knock you over.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">To assemble the salad:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the rice noodles and cook for 4 - 5 minutes until tender but not mushy. Immediately drain the noodles into a colander, and rinse them well with cold water to stop the cooking. Lay out a clean kitchen towel on he countertop, shake the colander to drain away excess water, and then spread the noodles on the towel to drain further.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Divide the noodles between 2 or 3 good sized bowls, and top with vegetables, herbs, and meat. Scatter the peanuts on top. Spoon on dressing to taste, toss well, and eat.</span><br />
