                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	We may have found ourselves devouring a very indulgent version of this dish at Andy Ricker’s (of famed Pok Pok) Phat Thai the other day. Andy’s pad thai is very traditional and contains a lot of oil and probably some sugar. So because we couldn’t get it out of our minds we decided that we would make our own version – lots of vegetables, minimal oil and no sugar. We have to say this dish might be less traditional but it is still high on the delicious scale. And if you’re not too concerned with being vegan this works stupendously well with fish sauce and a scrambled egg or two.

<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 bok choy, baby, thinly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 handful snow peas, ends trimmed, thinly sliced lengthwise</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt, coarse</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 handfuls watercress, roughly chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon sesame oil, toasted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 lime, halved</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 mint leaves, fresh, roughly chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced (white and light green parts only)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 handful peanuts, dry-roasted, roughly chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 jalapeño, green, thinly sliced (optional)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">optional for garnish eggs, scrambled</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Place the rice noodles in a large bowl and cover with nearly-boiling water. Let them sit until just softened, about 10 minutes. Drain them, cut them up a bit with scissors if they’re very long and set them aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet set over high heat. Add the garlic and cook until it’s just fragrant, only about 30 seconds. Add the peppers and cook, stirring a bit, until beginning to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the bok choy and the snow peas and cook until they begin to soften a bit too, just another minute or 2. Season the vegetables with a large pinch of salt and then stir in the reserved noodles and then fold in the watercress.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Turn off the heat and stir in the toasted sesame oil and another pinch of salt while you’re at it. Squeeze all the juice from the lime over the pad thai and stir to combine. Serve immediately with the herbs, scallions, peanuts and jalapeño. If you’re not totally vegan, serve with a splash of fish sauce too.</span><br />
