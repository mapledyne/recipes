                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	To time everything right, start the spinach when you add the tomatoes to the seitan. Of course, you can just enjoy the Sloppy Joes on their own sans spinach (but don’t you love your veggies?) or enjoy the spinach alongside any other jerk sorta’ recipe. And if you don’t feel like having sandwiches, this would be pretty awesome over rice, too.

Oh and I was considering calling these Sloppy Jerks or Jerky Joes, so in the privacy of your own home, feel free to call them whatever you like!

<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">For the spinach:</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons coconut oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cloves garlic, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 lb spinach, washed well, stems removed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup coconut milk</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 star anise</span><br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Prepare the Sloppy Joe:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Preheat a large, heavy bottomed pan over medium-high heat. Saute onion in one tablespoon coconut oil and a pinch of salt, until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add the seitan and cook for about 10 minutes, until nicely browned, stirring often. Push the seitan and onions to one side of the pan so that you have space to quickly saute the garlic and ginger. Put the remaining teaspoon of coconut oil in the pan and toss in the garlic and ginger, stirring as it sizzles, for about 15 seconds. Then mix it up with the seitan and onions.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add thyme, paprika, salt, allspice, red pepper flakes, cinnamon and black pepper and toss to coat everything and cook the spices a bit.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add the tomatoes, and cook for about 10 more minutes, tossing often. Lastly, mix in the maple syrup, lime juice and mustard. Let cook for a minute or so, then taste for salt and seasonings, and serve.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Prepare the spinach:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Preheat a large, heavy bottomed pan over medium heat. Quickly saute the garlic in coconut oil, just so it sizzles for a few seconds, being careful that it doesn’t burn. Add the spinach in batches, tossing with tongs, until it is all wilted and fits in the pan. Cook for about 3 minutes, until a lot of moisture is released.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Now we’re going to get rid of the excess moisture, but try not to lose any garlic or spinach in the process. Shove the spinach off to one side, and carefully (don’t burn yourself, dummy!) lift the pan and drain the excess water into the sink. The spinach might all just behave itself and stay on one side of the pot, but use the tongs to keep it from falling into the sink just in case.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Now return to the heat, add the coconut milk, star anise and salt. Bring coconut milk to a boil and stir often, for about 5 minutes, so that the star anise releases its flavor. Turn the heat off and let it rest for 10 minutes or so, soaking up the coconut milk yumminess.</span><br />
