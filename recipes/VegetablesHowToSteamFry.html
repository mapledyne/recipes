	Need a quick side dish of vegetables to go with your meal? Try steam-frying them!

Using this method, you quickly stir-fry vegetables to develop some color, and then steam them until tender. Steam-frying uses less oil than a regular stir-fry, but the vegetables still quickly cook through.

The veggies also pick up a little browning from the stir-fry step and some flavor from the liquid used for the steaming step, making them more exciting than plain steamed vegetables.

You can use this technique to cook just about any vegetable in the fridge, from cauliflower to green beans.

Feel free to substitute any of favorite vegetable for those in this recipe, such as broccoli, bell peppers, onion, fennel, asparagus, or zucchini. Cut into bite-sized pieces for cooking. (Note: Asparagus and other delicate vegetables will cook slightly more quickly; begin checking for doneness sooner than with other vegetables.)

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 pound cauliflower, cut into 1-inch florets</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 pound green beans, cut into 1-inch pieces</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 pound carrots, sliced 1/4-inch thick</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2  teaspoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup water, stock, wine or other liquid</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons parsley, chopped, (optional)</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Heat the oil, then add the vegetables. In a 12-inch skillet over medium heat, heat the olive oil until it begins to shimmer.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add the vegetables in a single layer. It's fine if the vegetables overlap, but try not to crowd the pan too much; cook in two batches if you're using a smaller skillet. Sprinkle the salt evenly over top.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Stir-fry the vegetables until they have some light brown spots, about 5 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Add the water or other liquid and cover the skillet. Let the vegetables steam, covered, just until tender. This usually takes about 4 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Check the vegetables. Uncover the pan and use a fork to spear a few of the vegetables and see if they're tender or still crunchy. If done, cook the vegetables, uncovered, just another minute or so to let any remaining liquid evaporate from the pan. If not done, add another tablespoon or two of liquid, cover, and steam a bit longer</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Serve: When the vegetables are tender, transfer them to a serving dish. Sprinkle with parsley (optional) and serve while still warm.</span><br />
