                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	A couple of years ago, I had a major bumper crop of zucchini. I found a million ways to eat it and cook with it, but this simple meal of shrimp with zucchini noodles and lemon-garlic butter was one I went back to again and again.

I’ve tried making zucchini ribbons with a simple vegetable peeler, a mandolin, and a spiralizer. I personally like using a vegetable peeler or mandolin the best. Making these wide pappardelle-like noodles wastes less of the vegetable than curly, spiralized zoodles. Also their texture is just so lovely.

Most mandolins will produce a slightly thicker noodle than the peeler. You might need to cook the noodles a minute or so longer if your noodles seem fairly thick.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 zucchini, medium</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 to 1 teaspoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons butter</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cloves garlic, finely minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Zest from 1 lemon</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice, fresh-squeezed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">(optional) parsley, fresh chopped, to garnish</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Prepare the zucchini: Slice each zucchini down its length using a vegetable peeler or on a mandolin, creating long, thin ribbons. Stop when you get to the core, which doesn't peel well (and eat it as a snack!).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay the noodles out on paper towels in a single layer and sprinkle them with salt. Leave them to “sweat” for about 10 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Melt the butter and steep the garlic: In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Tilt and swirl the pan gently to move the butter around. The butter will foam a bit, then begin to smell nutty and turn amber with small brown solids on the bottom.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Once this happens, immediately pour butter into a heat-proof bowl, jar, or cup. Use a spatula to scrape all of the browned bits into the bowl. Add the minced garlic to butter and set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Season the shrimp: Pat the cleaned shrimp with a paper towel to remove any excess moisture, then toss them with a heavy pinch of salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Cook the shrimp: Wipe the skillet used to melt the butter clean. Return it to medium-high heat. When the skillet is hot (but not smoking) add just enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Working in batches, cook the shrimp for about 2 minutes on each side. They should be pink and opaque, but not curled up too tightly. Transfer to a plate.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Cook the zucchini noodles: Pat the excess moisture from the noodles. Place the skillet back over medium high heat, and add a bit of cooking oil (just enough to coat).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Toss the zucchini gently in the pan so that it just begins to lose its stiffness. You want it to be al dente, just like pasta. The whole process shouldn’t take more than 3 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove the pan from heat.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Toss everything together and serve: Whisk lemon zest and juice into the brown butter and garlic. Off the heat, add the shrimp back to the pan with the zucchini and pour the lemon-garlic butter over top.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Toss to combine. Transfer to a serving platter or individual plates. Top with fresh parsley and serve.</span><br />
