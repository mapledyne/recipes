                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	My grandmother made brandy snaps and put them in pretty tin boxes for friends around the holidays. To make the hollow logs, she wrapped the just-baked dough around pencils. According to my mother, my grandmother would have cleaned her out of her #2 pencils for school by mid-December. I never had the chance to taste the originals, but I've certainly enjoyed the recipe since it was passed down to me!

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup butter</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup sugar, granulated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2/3 cup molasses, dark</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon cinnamon</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon ginger</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 teaspoons brandy</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">cream, heavy whipping</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Preheat oven to 325Â° F.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Stir butter, sugar, molasses, cinnamon, and ginger together over low heat until melted.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Remove from heat and add flour and brandy. Chill the dough until firm enough to shape, about 20 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Roll into 3/4-inch balls and place on the baking sheet. Leave room for them to spread.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Bake for approximately 12 to 13 minutes on Silpat- or parchment paper-lined cookie sheet.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. When the cookies have cooled enough that you can touch them but they are still warm (about 5 minutes), use a spatula to pull them from the sheet and quickly roll them around a pencil to form tubes (rubber gloves recommended to prevent your fingers from burning). When the cookies are flat, they should look almost like a lace cookie. They are very fragile, so if you over bake, they'll break and be too brittle to roll; under-baking just a smudge is good.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. If you'd like (and are serving immediately), whip up some heavy whipping cream and dot each end of the rolled cookies with it.</span><br />
