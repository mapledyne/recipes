	This dish is all about the balance between savory and sweet fall flavors. I find that I can't get enough apples this time of year—raw, in cider, or in sauce.  (…more) —meganvt01

Food52 Review: Megan's Farro Risotto is a comforting, fall-inspired party side dish. The creaminess of the risotto and the tartness of the apples worked surprisingly well together and the crunchy walnut topping and hint of orange zest gave it a well-rounded finish. I served this with a roasted whole chicken and a glass of earthy Tempranillo. I am definitely looking forward to serving this again!

<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 fennel bulb, trimmed and chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon butter</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup wine, white</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups farro</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cups apple cider</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cups chicken broth</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 onion, medium sweet, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 large cloves garlic, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup wine, white</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon orange zest</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup chèvre, crumbled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup walnuts, toasted and chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 tablespoons parsley, chopped</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon butter</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">For the caramelized apples and fennel:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. This can be done concurrently with the risotto. In a large skillet over medium heat melt the butter with the olive oil and add the apples and fennel. Salt and stir.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Cook over medium heat for about 20 minutes. At first the mix will release liquid then they will start to cook down -- after about 10 minutes, keep an eye on them so they don't get too brown. When they are tender and brown, deglaze the pan with the wine scraping up any brown bits. Reserve.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">For the farro risotto:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Add the chicken broth and apple cider to a saucepan. Maintain on a very low simmer during the cooking of the risotto.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. In another saucepan add the olive oil and onions and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Add the drained farro and stir to coat. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently and allowing the grains to toast slightly. Add the white wine and cook until the liquid is almost absorbed.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. For the next 30 minutes (approximately), add the cider/broth mixture to the farro mixture by ladlefuls. Stir after each addition and cook until the liquid is almost absorbed. Repeat until the farro is tender but still al dente (or to your desired doneness).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. When you add the last ladleful of the broth/cider mixture and the liquid is almost gone, add the caramelized apples and fennel, fennel seeds, orange zest, Parmesan, and butter. Stir and season to taste.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">8. Put the farro in a serving dish and top with chèvre, toasted walnuts, and parsley. Serve immediately.</span><br />
