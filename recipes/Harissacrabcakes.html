                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 scallions (green onions), finely choped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons oil, grapeseed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg white</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon sauce, harissa</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 oz crab meat</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 limes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">pepper, freshly ground</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place the egg white, Harissa, cut scallions, and 10 turns of pepper in a large bowl.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Squeeze the crab meat over the sink to remove excess water, then add to the bowl. Mix everything together.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Sculpt the crab cakes: form the mixture into 4 tightly packed patties about 2 1/2" in diameter and 1/2" thick.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Pour 8" diameter circle (about 2 tablespoons) oil into a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. As soon as it starts to shimmer, move to the next step.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add the crab cakes and keep track of the order added to the skillet - start at 12 o'clock and work clockwise.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Don't fuss with them. Let them cook in peace for 3 minutes, until nicely browned of the bottom, which will hold them together. Carefully turn them over in the order you put them down. Smooth them down to approximately equal thickness, then cook for another 3 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove to individual serving plates and squeeze lime juice on top. Don't hold back on the lime.</span><br />
