                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cup all purpose flour</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 tsp baking soda</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 cup sugar, brown</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup butter,unsalted, cut into 8 slices</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 large egg, room temperature</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tsp pure vanilla extract</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 cup chocolate chips or 4.5 ounce bar, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup pecans, lightly toasted and roughly chopped</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Mix flour, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl and set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat a pan on medium heat. Add butter slices and melt in pan. Stir continuously. Butter will foam up. After foam subsides, small brown flecks will start to appear in bottom of pan. Continue stirring, until butter has reached a nice brown color, and nutty aroma. Remove from heat at this point. Don't heat it any more or it may burn.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add browned butter and sugar to your stand mixer bowl. Mix well. Add in egg and vanilla, and mix them in thoroughly. Slowly stir in the flour mixture. Finally, add and evenly distribute the chocolate chips by mixing.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Scoop dough into individual ramekins. Sprinkle some pecans on top (they get toasty in the oven!). Bake for 8-10 minutes. Your pizzookies are ready when the edges are cooked, but the center is still gooey. Top with vanilla ice cream and gobble it up!</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">If you want to make these as normal cookies, just roll them into 1" balls and bake about 10-13 minutes until the edges are just set.</span><br />
