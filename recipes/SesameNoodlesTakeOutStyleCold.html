                <span itemprop="description">
	Do I need to tell you what an easy and delicious summer lunch or dinner this can be? How friendly it might be to my too tired or unmotivated to cook brethren, because you can make the sauce, comprised mostly of pantry ingredients, whenever you find 10 minutes of free time and keep it until needed, the noodles are supposed to be cold, and your cucumbers will stay crisp as long as you need them to? No, I do not. But I’ve never let that stop me before, either.

I used wide, flat rice noodles (often sold as rice “sticks” typically used for pad Thai here, but 1/8-inch thick Chinese egg noodles, sold frozen or fresh at Asian markets, are more takeout traditional (but not gluten-free).

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 pound rice noodles, dried (see note)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons sesame oil, toasted, plus a splash to loosen noodles</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons tahini paste, (or Chinese sesame paste)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon peanut butter, smooth</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons vinegar, rice</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon sugar, granulated or brown</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon ginger, fresh, finely grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons garlic, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Chili-garlic paste, to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 pound cucumber, very thinly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup peanuts, roasted salted, roughly chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">A handful of herbs, such as mint and cilantro, chopped fresh for garnish</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cook noodles according to package directions and rinse with cold water to cool. Drain well. Drizzle with a tiny splash of toasted sesame oil to keep them from sticking until dressed.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, whisk sesame paste and peanut butter in the bottom of a small bowl, then whisk in soy sauce, rice vinegar, remaining 2 tablespoons sesame oil, sugar, ginger, garlic and chile-garlic paste to taste until smooth. Adjust flavors to taste. It might seem a bit salty from the bowl, but should be just right when tossed with noodles.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Toss sauce with cold noodles.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place a medium-sized knot of dressed noodles in each bowl, followed by a pile of cucumber. Garnish generously with peanuts and herbs. Serve with extra chile-garlic paste on the side.</span><br />
