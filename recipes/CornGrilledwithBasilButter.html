                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	This is a fast and simple way to make corn truly sing. The basil adds a delightful brightness to the sweet corn, and it plays perfectly with the traditional butter and salt additions. Grilling the corn takes the most time, which was only about 6 minutes. The basil butter is a keeper -- and it's a good thing, because there is a lot of it left over. I would definitely make this recipe again.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ears corn on the cob, shucked</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 sticks butter, unsalted, at room temperature</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup basil, loosely packed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon sea salt</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Preheat grill to medium hot.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Roll corn in a little olive oil and sprinkle with salt. When grill is hot, add corn and close the lid. Rotate the corn a few times, until some of the kernels are blistered and the rest a bright and shiny yellow. This shouldn't take longer than 8 minutes. Be careful not to overcook, or the corn will be dry.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Meanwhile, add the butter, basil, and salt to a food processer and let it rip. You may need to scrape down the sides once or twice. When the basil is finely chopped and the butter has a light green tint, it's done.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. When the corn comes off the grill, slather it with the basil butter. Sprinkle with a little more salt if desired. Eat immediately.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Note: basil butter can be made ahead and extra basil butter will keep for about a week or two in the fridge. You can roll it into a log with plastic wrap and slice it off as you need it. It's AMAZING on toast.</span><br />
