                <span itemprop="description">
	A surefire way to get anyone to eat any vegetable, these crisp babies are delicious as a side dish, alone as an appetizer, or served on a bed of greens as lunch. Root vegetables are most common, but you can use whatever looks good to you, alone or in combination: zucchini, yellow squash, winter squash, corn, or chopped scallions; even spinach or chard is good (just cook it, squeeze it dry, and chop it first). And consider tossing in a tablespoon of fresh herbs or spices. Sweet potato and corn benefit from a bit of cilantro, zucchini comes to life with dill, and ginger or cardamom will warm up winter squash beautifully.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">About 1 1/2 pounds (3 cups packed) grated vegetables, peeled first if necessary and squeezed dry</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 small onion or 4 scallions, grated;</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg, lightly beaten</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup white or whole wheat flour, more or less</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">freshly ground black pepper</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">olive or vegetable oil or butter for greasing the pan</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1.Heat the oven to 275°F. Grate the vegetable or vegetables by hand or with the grating disk of a food processor. Mix together the vegetables, onion, egg, and 1/4 cup of the flour. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add a little more flour if the mixture isn’t holding together.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2.Put a little butter or oil in a large skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. When the butter is melted or the oil is hot, drop in spoonfuls of the batter, using a fork to spread the vegetables into an even layer, press down a bit. Work in batches to prevent overcrowding. (Transfer finished pancakes to the oven until all are finished.) Cook, turning once, until nicely browned on both sides, about 5 minutes. Serve hot or at room temperature.</span><br />
