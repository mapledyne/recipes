                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	Oh, I am sorry. Did you want me to discuss these? Like, you don’t know already everything you need to? Fine. There is a very small amount of butter, a colossal amount of chocolate, a few chopped up candy bars and walnuts and, if you’re me, a little sprinkling of flaky sea salt which comes together to form the first cookie I have made that comes close to matching or–I hope you’re sitting down for this–surpassing the transcendence of the World Peace Cookies.

Frankly, you’re either in you kitchen fixing to make these right now, or you haven’t considered the implications of what I have shared above. But considering that echo out there, I am going to assume it is the former.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup flour, all purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon baking powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound chocolate, bittersweet (not unsweetened) or semisweet, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter, unsalted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 3/4 cups (packed) sugar, brown</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 eggs, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon vanilla extract</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 x 1.4 oz bars English toffee bars (such as Heath), -ounce chocolate-covered coarsely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup walnuts, toasted, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">for sprinkling sea salt, Flaky, (optional)</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Combine flour, baking powder and salt in small bowl; whisk to blend. Stir chocolate and butter in top of double boiler set over simmering water until melted and smooth. Remove from over water. Cool mixture to lukewarm.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Using electric mixer, beat sugar and eggs in bowl until thick, about 5 minutes. Beat in chocolate mixture and vanilla.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Stir in flour mixture, then toffee and nuts. Chill batter until firm, about 45 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Preheat oven to 350°F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment or waxed paper. Drop batter by spoonfuls onto sheets, spacing two inches apart. Sprinkle with a pinch of flaky sea salt, if you’re using it. Bake just until tops are dry and cracked but cookies are still soft to touch, about 12 to 15 minutes. Cool on sheets. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">I know that it will be impossible to let them cool completely, but they really taste a lot better cool, as they continue baking once they come out of the oven.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Slice and bake option: After struggling a bit to scoop these cookies, I rolled the dough into a log 1.5 inches in diameter and chilled it. When I was ready to bake the cookies, I cut it into 1/2-inch slices. You can store the dough log in the freezer, wrapped in waxed paper and then two layers of plastic wrap for up to a month, just baking the cookies off as you need. Cookies baked straight from the freezer may need an additional minute or two in the oven, depending on their thickness.</span><br />
