                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	This is a super-quick throw-together that's elegant, rustic, and very tasty served with warm country bread and olive oil. The first time I had this was in Barcelona, 25 years ago. I have been making it ever since, and my only addition are the hard-boiled eggs for more oomph. The contrast of soft eggs, crunchy onions, salty tuna, and sweet beans is addictive.  (less) —olive

Food52 Review: This recipe was both easy to prepare as well as beautiful. It was delicious on it’s own, however I added some lemon zest for freshness and flaky sea salt to finish. I loved it so much, I made it a second time using sherry vinegar in place of the lemon juice. This increased the complexity of the salad’s flavors and enhanced the nuttiness of the dukkah. I would describe it as a Spanish play on a Niçoise salad. Paired with grilled country bread and olive oil, it made for a perfect dinner.
