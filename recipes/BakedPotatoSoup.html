                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 pounds russet potatoes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 pound bacon Nueske's brand. Cherrywood smoked, green package (exact), cut crosswise into 1/8-inch slices</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 onion, large, finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 celery ribs, finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 cups chicken stock</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon kosher salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/8 teaspoon white or black pepper, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 Tbsp cream, heavy</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">sharp cheddar cheese, grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">sour cream, full fat</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">scallions (green onions), minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">bacon, crumbled</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Scrub the potatoes clean and poke them all over with the tines of a fork or paring knife (this is so they don't explode from internal pressure building up as they cook). Place on a foil lined baking sheet and bake at 400¬∞F for 1 hour, or until easily cut through with a knife. Remove and let cool enough to handle. (To speed up cooling, slice them in half lengthwise.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Place bacon lardons in a large, thick bottomed Dutch oven (about 5 to 6 quart pot). Heat on medium high until the bacon starts to brown then lower the heat to medium. Cook until the bacon has rendered most of its fat and the lardons are browned and crispy. Remove the cooked bacon and set aside. Remove all but 1 tablespoon of bacon fat from the pan. (Do not discard bacon fat in your sink, it will clog the drain. Pour the fat¬†into a jar and let it cool and solidify. Then either scoop it out and discard it or use it for another purpose.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Add the chopped onion and celery to the remaining bacon fat in the pot.¬†Cook for 2 minutes on medium high, then lower the heat to low, and cover the pot. Let cool slowly on low heat for 15 to 20 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. When potatoes are cool enough to handle, scoop out the insides to a bowl. Then add it to the cooked onion and celery mixture along with 6 cups chicken stock. Add a teaspoon of kosher salt. Bring the soup to a simmer and reduce the heat to low. Use a potato masher to mash the potatoes into the stock.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Cook the potato soup for about 5 minutes, then use an immersion blender to pur√©e¬†about half of the soup if you want a slightly chunky soup, or pur√©e all of it if you want a smoother soup. Stir 2 to 4 tablespoons of heavy cream into the soup if you want a creamier soup. Add more salt and pepper to taste.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Pour into bowls and top with grated cheddar, sour cream, chives, and crumbled crispy¬†bacon.</span><br />
