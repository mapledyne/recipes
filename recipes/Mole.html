<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 2" slice french bread, day old</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup sesame seeds</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon anise seeds</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cloves, whole</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cinnamon, stick</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1.5 14.5 oz cans tomatoes, fire-roasted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 onion, white</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3-5 garlic cloves, skin on</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 quarts stock, chicken</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3-6 oz chocolate, Mexican, (Barra and Abuelita brands most common)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">to taste salt, kosher</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Note: lean towards the 6oz of chocolate.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Note: Chiles can be found in spice world at the Pike Market and other places.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Note: This keeps better in the fridge (or freezer) if there isn't chicken in it, so cooking the sauce separately from the chicken allows for more leftover flexibility.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a dry skillet, toast the chiles until they are slightly aromatic. Tear open the chiles and place the seeds in a small bowl (to be used later). Break the chiles into pieces.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a skillet, over medium heat melt about two tablespoons of lard. In batches, sauté the peppers until they change color and become fragrant. Add more lard as needed. Be careful not to burn the chiles. Remove them from the pan either with tongs or a slotted spoon to leave the fat behind. Place them in a large bowl.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In the same skillet, add about 2  tablespoons more of lard and sauté the raisins until they are plump. Remote them and place them in the bowl with the chiles. Add the almonds and toast until slightly brown, then add to the large bowl. One by one, continue the same process with the peanuts, tortilla, and french bread, adding more lard if necessary. Any time during this the stock can be added (See next step).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Pour 1 qt of cold stick over the ingredients in the bowl, adding just enough additional water to cover them.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a dry skillet, toast the sesame seeds until they are a golden brown, making sure to stir them frequently. Set some aside for a garnish and add the rest to the bowl with the chiles. In the same pan, toast the pumpkin seeds until they are slightly golden and add them to the bowl with the chiles.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Mix anise seeds, coriander, cloves, cinnamon, 1-2 tbsp of the chile seeds (the more the spicier). Toast the spices and seeds in a skillet for about 30 seconds until aromatic. Add to the rest of the ingredients. If needed, add more water to cover the mixture.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In the same dry skillet, grill the onion (cut into big chunks) and the garlic (peel on) until black spots start to appear. Peel garlic and add the garlic and onion to the bowl.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Let all ingredients soak for 30 minutes at room temperature or (better) overnight in the fridge.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a blender or food processor, puree the mixture (with its soaking liquid) with the canned tomatoes. Add more stock if necessary to achieve a smooth but thick batter-like consistence. If necessary, strain the sauce to remove large pieces (usually not needed).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a large pot or dutch oven, over medium high heat, melt 1/4 cup of lard until it is very hot. Then add the chile mixture. It should sizzle when added. Then lower the heat to medium and cook for 30 minutes stirring constantly.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add one tablet of chocolate, season with salt and cook over low heat for 30 more minutes. Taste and add more salt or chocolate as necessary.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cook for another 45 min to an hour. Add stock as needed, if the mole is getting too thick.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Note: The mole is ready to eat at this point. However, it tastes better after it rests for one to two days. Let it cool and refrigerate 24 to 48 hours. To reheat, warm the mole up in a saucepan over medium low heat.</span><br />
