                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	Katy Keck, a culinary consultant, told me about sugar steak, a dish completely foreign to me. What, you've never heard of it either? Good. Time for us all to get up to speed. 

Sugar steak is very much what it sounds like: steak that's blanketed with a sugar rub and grilled. Katy, who got her recipe for it by surveying the chefs at the Spring Lake Yacht Club close to Lake Michigan, said, "Some use sirloin, some use rib-eye, I have even used CAB top round –- most agree whatever is cheapest. Also some use white sugar, some use brown, some use both." She uses dark brown sugar. 

Katy has also come up with a fool-proof technique. "I have a Weber-performer and don’t use the lid on this, nor am I stingy with charcoal," she said. "It’s really impressive when you get 3 steaks going at once (total 14 pounds of meat), though I nearly set the porch roof on fire. Rip-snorting is the official temperature for the grill."

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 flank steak</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup sugar, brown</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup bourbon</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Layer together the flank steak, sugar, bourbon, and red pepper flakes in a bowl. Rub the sugar and red pepper flakes into the steak. Put the steak in a 1-gallon plastic bag, add the remaining sugar mixture, seal the bag, and let it rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes and up to 3 hours.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Heat the broiler (or grill) and lay the steak on a baking sheet (one that you're ok with warping under the broiler). Generously season the steak all over with salt. Place the steak under the broiler -- it should be 4 to 6 inches from the flame -- and broil for 3 minutes on each side for medium rare. Transfer the steak to a cutting board and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes, then cut into 1/4-inch slices.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Serve with mashed potatoes and sauteed bitter greens.</span><br />
