                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 lbs kale</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup butter, unsalted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt, kosher, Diamond Crystal brand (exact)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">pepper, black, freshly ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">lemon, cut in wedges</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Stem and wash the kale, shaking off excess water. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the kale until tender, about 5 - 10 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Drain the kale in a large colander, then let cold water run over it until it is cool enough to handle. Using your hands, squeeze most of the water out. It does not need to be squeezed completely dry. The roughly chop the kale.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Melt the butter in a very large saute pan over medium-high heat. Allow the butter to bubble and turn golden brown, with a toasted fragrance. Watch carefully - this will only take a few minutes. Add the kale to the pan and stir it around until it's mixed with the butter and warmed through. Season to taste with salt and pepper and remove from the heat.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Pile on a platter and garnish with lemon wedges to serve over.</span><br />
