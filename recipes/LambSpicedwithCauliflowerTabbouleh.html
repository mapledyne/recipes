                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cloves garlic, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 bag cauliflower rice</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound lamb, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons baharat or hawaii spice blend, (if you can't find either, use a mix of equal parts cardamom, turmeric, coriander, and cumin)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 cucumbers, small Persian, diced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tomatoes, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 lemon, zest and juice of</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup parsley, fresh, roughly chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup cilantro, fresh, optional for garnishing</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">sea salt, flaky, for garnishing</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup water, warm</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup tahini</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons lemon juice, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt, to taste</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium-high heat and add the garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 2 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Add the chopped cauliflower and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and starting to brown, about 8 minutes. (Note: If you want to make your prep easier, it's really easy to chop the cauliflower by tossing it in the food processor and pulsing a few times.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Season with salt and pepper and add a drizzle of olive oil to the cooked cauliflower.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Transfer the cooked cauliflower to a large bowl. Don't wipe out the pan.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. To the bowl of cauliflower, add the cucumbers, tomatoes, lemon zest, lemon juice, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper and toss to combine. Set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. In the same skillet, heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil. Add the ground lamb and spices (I alternate between baharat and hawaijj depending on my mood or what I have in the pantry. Both are delicious with lamb.). Season with salt and pepper, and cook over medium-high heat until the lamb browns, breaking it up with a spatula as it cooks.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. To make the dressing: Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl and whisk until smooth. It should be pourable; if it's too thick, add more warm water. It should be easy to drizzle but not super thin.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">8. Divide the cauliflower mixture between two bowls, and divide the lamb on top of both bowls. Top with a liberal drizzle of the tahini dressing. Garnish with flaky sea salt and a handful of fresh cilantro.</span><br />
