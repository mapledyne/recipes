                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups flour, whole wheat</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup oats, plus more for finishing</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/4 cups warm water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup honey</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 tablespoons butter, unsalted, melted</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, mix the flours, oats, salt, and yeast to combine. Add the water, honey, and butter and mix on low speed until the mixture forms a ball around the hook. (This can also be done by hand in a large bowl using a wooden spoon).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Raise speed to medium and mix until the dough is smooth and elastic, 5 minutes more. (This can also be done by hand on a clean surface for 10 to 12 minutes).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Transfer the dough to a lightly greased medium bowl and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 375° F.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Shape the dough into an oblong shape by pressing it out into a rectangle about 1-inch thick, then folding it over onto itself to expel excess air. Seal the final fold using the heel of your hand, then gently roll into an oblong loaf. Place the dough, seal side down, into a lightly greased 9-inch loaf pan.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Let the dough rise inside the pan until nearly double in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Brush the surface with water and sprinkle with more oats.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Bake the loaf until golden brown and crusty (and until the internal temperature reads about 195° F), 45 minutes to 1 hour. Don’t be afraid of browning. This is one of my steadfast rules of bread baking, but it's especially important when you’re using a darker flour to start with. Follow the baking time and then (carefully) tap the loaves with your finger. A loaf with a properly formed, crisp crust will sound slightly hollow when you tap it. Remove the bread and (here’s the hard part) cool completely before serving for the best interior crumb structure.  Cool completely before slicing and serving.</span><br />
