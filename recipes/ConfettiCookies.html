	Recipe barely adapted from King Arthur, technique and language were tinkered with

If you’re using a food processer, no need to soften the butter or cream cheese first. If using an electric hand- or stand mixer, you’ll want them softened before you mix the dough. If you’re using vanilla bean, which I really love here, I find you can maximize the flavor you get out of it by rubbing the vanilla bean seeds right into your sugar, distributing it evenly and giving it a extra flavor-releasing abrasion. Then use the sugar as written below.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cups flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon baking powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon baking soda</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 teaspoon salt, table</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup butter, unsalted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup cream cheese</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/4 cups sugar, granulated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 eggs, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons vanilla extract or 1/2 a vanilla bean, split and scraped (see Note up top)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup rainbow sprinkles</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat oven to 375 degrees. Line two baking large sheets with parchment paper.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">To make in a food processor: Place flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in the work bowl and pulse a few times to blend. Add butter and cream cheese in large chunks, plus sugar and blend until mixture is powdery. Add egg, vanilla and almond extracts and run machine until the dough balls together. You’ll probably need to scrape it down once or twice to get the mixture even.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">To make with an electric mixer: Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a bowl and whisk to blend. In a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, beat cream cheese, butter and sugar until fluffy. Add egg and extracts and blend again. Add flour mixture and beat just until flour disappears. In some cases, this dough will feel too soft to roll into balls in your hands; if so, let it chill in the fridge for 20 minutes or so before using.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Both methods: Scoop balls of dough — I like these cookies best with a #40, or 1 1/2 tablespoon, scoop; the texture is less dynamic when made smaller — and roll them briefly in the palms of your hands before dropping them in a bowl of rainbow sprinkles and gently rolling to coat them evenly. I find that the sprinkles adhere much better to tacky exterior of balls of dough that have been briefly warmed by your hands — trust me here.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Transfer balls of sprinkle-coated dough to baking sheets at least two inches apart. Use the bottom of a drinking glass to press down on the cookies until they are about 1/4 to 1/2-inch tall. If you see any bare spots in the sprinkles that bother you, you can sprinkle a few more on top. Bake for 9 to 10 minutes until they look underbaked but lightly golden underneath. [If they’re not quite soft in the center, they will be fully crisped through the next day.] Let set on the baking sheet on a rack for a few minutes before transferring to cooling racks to cool the rest of the way. Repeat with remaining cookie dough.</span><br />
