                <span itemprop="description">
	Author Notes: I needed a quick dinner for my family this fall. I used all the fall flavors I could get my hands on! Making the brown butter before adding the onions really gave it a delicious nutty taste. My picky teen (who will not normally touch an onion) ate it and asked for more! —Donna 

Food52 Review: Once seasoned, the spices (sage, thyme, rosemary, and a pinch of cinnamon) were quite nice together and paired well with the brown butter, apples, onions and pork. Personally, I would double the apple and onions piece and season the meat first before frying with salt and pepper and maybe some sage. This could be a nice and quick weeknight meal.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 onion, sweet</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons butter, unsalted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon sage, dried</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 apple, sweet</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon thyme, dried</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 to 1/2 teaspoons rosemary, dried, crushed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pinch brown sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">cinnamon, to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 pork chops, thin cut</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">cider, apple, as needed</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Cut your onion into long thin strands - I use a mandoline. Use what you need and freeze the rest for another day.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Cut apples into chunks - quarter the apple, then cut each quarter into thirds lengthwise, then cut each slice in half crosswise.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Sage brown butter. On med-med high heat melt the butter (low & slow) until it starts to foam & turn brown. Add the sage brown for 15-30 seconds.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Add onions. Sautee until caramelized (again, low & slow)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Add apples. Stir until apples are covered in the butter</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Add thyme & rosemary...stir</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Sprinkle brown sugar and cinnamon...stir</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">8. Add pork chops - you can either remove the apples, brown the chops and then add the apples back or just push the apples out of the way so the chops are touching the pan. Brown on one side. Flip brown & cook through on the other side. (The apples and onions can be on top of the chops while they are browning to give flavor.) At this point sometimes (not always, depends how fast they are cooking and how much butter and juice released from apples there is) I add just a teeny bit of water (or apple cider if you have it) and cover to make sure the chops are cooked through and softens the apples if needed. The chops are thin so they cook pretty quickly</span><br />
