                <span itemprop="description">
	Mine is a family of carb lovers, and the dinner rolls are always the first thing to go at any meal, holiday or otherwise.

This is especially true when these potato rolls are on the menu. Mashed potatoes make the rolls extra-soft and fluffy. I top them with some honey butter and they disappear like magic.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup water, room temperature</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 1/4 teaspoon (1 packet) yeast, active-dry or instant</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon plus 1/3 cup sugar, divided</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup mashed potatoes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup milk</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 tablespoons butter, salted, melted and cooled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 eggs, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 1/2 teaspoons rosemary leaves, fresh, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 teaspoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 1/2 to 5 cups flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup butter, salted, room temperature</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoon honey</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Proof the yeast: In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the water, the yeast, and 1 teaspoon of the sugar. Set aside for about 5 minutes, or until the mixture looks bubbly. If the mixture doesn't start to bubble, then your yeast has likely expired and it's best to start over with new yeast.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Mix the dough: Add the remaining sugar, mashed potatoes, milk, butter, eggs, rosemary, and salt to the bowl with the yeast mixture and stir with a spatula until smooth. Add 4 1/2 cups of the flour and mix until you form a shaggy dough.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Knead the dough: With a dough hook attachment (or on the counter, if kneading by hand) knead on medium-low for 5 to 7 minutes until the dough is smooth, forms a ball around the dough hook, and pulls away from the sides of the bowl (it's fine if the dough sticks to the bottom of the bowl). If the dough is still sticking to the sides after few minutes of kneading, add in a little more flour 2 tablespoons at a time.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Let the dough rise: Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and place somewhere warm for about 1 hour, or until the dough doubles in size.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Shape the dough into rolls: Line a 13x9-inch baking pan with parchment paper and lightly grease. Turn the dough the out onto lightly floured surface and cut into 16 to 20 equal pieces. Roll the dough into small balls, and place seam side down in the baking dish.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Cover and let the rolls rise until puffed and nearly doubled in size, about 1 hour. About 15 minutes before the rolls are ready, heat the oven to 350F.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Bake for the rolls for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the rolls are golden brown on top and register 200F on the inside when tested with an instant-read thermometer.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">8. Brush the rolls with honey butter: In a small dish, mix together 1/4 cup room temperature butter and 2 tablespoons honey until smooth. Brush tops of baked rolls with mixture, then sprinkle with salt. Allow to cool slightly before serving.</span><br />
