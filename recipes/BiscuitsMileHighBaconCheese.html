                <span itemprop="description">
	I know what you're thinking: Who brings biscuits to a potluck? One bite of Mile-High Bacon Cheese Biscuits, and the answer will be you! They combine easy-to-work-with dough and the layering technique of puff pastry. They're great at brunch with poached eggs, with soup or – my favourite – warm from the oven with a slice of tomato and shredded iceberg lettuce tucked inside (instant BLT). Cooking the bacon with water helps it brown evenly and makes for a hands-off experience, freeing you up to work on the rest of the biscuit.

<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups cheese, cheddar (Tillamook, sharp), shredded</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 cups flour, all-purpose</span><br />

Bring up short ends of dough to meet in centre; pinch dough to seal. Turn dough 90 degrees clockwise. Repeat patting into rectangle, filling and turning, twice.</span><br />

Pat or roll out1 half into 8 inch (20 cm) square; cut into 16 pieces. Repeat with remaining half.
