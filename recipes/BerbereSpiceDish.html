                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 large onion, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 half of a large tomato, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoons berbere spice</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 - 2 cans beans or lentils, rinsed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 eggs, scramble and cook until egg is cooked.</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">bread, white, for serving</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add tomato and onion to a frying pan in a tablespoon or so of oil (about med or med-high heat)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add 1-2 tablespoons of berbere and cook everything together for at least 10 min (can cook for a long time on lower heat - thats how they seem to do it but I think 10-15 min is enough)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add 1-2 cans of rinsed beans or lentils (I haven't found the exact type of beans they have, but similar to lima beans, but I have tried many kinds, whatever you prefer) to mixture in frying pan. cook for 5-10min, squishing the beans and mixing everything together. The amount of beans added should be about equal to the amount of onion/tomato mix.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">On medium heat, add 6 eggs, scramble and cook until egg is cooked. This is about the serving size for one person so you can scale up or down.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Serve with white crusty bread or buns, tear of bites and pick up egg/berbere mix with the bread.</span><br />
