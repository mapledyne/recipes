                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon milk, (or water)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt, to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">pepper black, freshly ground, to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 tablespoon butter</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">filling of your choice</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Crack the egg into a bowl large enough to take some action, add the milk and season with salt and pepper. Whisk until completely mixed and streak free.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat a skillet just right to medium low, the butter should melt then foam gently. When it stops, add the egg. Tilt the skillet around so the egg swirls to cover it all.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">When it's set all over with a liquidy part still left in the middle, add the filling to the side you're flipping onto, which will be the bottom on the omelet (for righties, the left hand side). Run a small spatula around the perimeter of the omelet to loosen the edges and then slip it under the unfilled. Fold it over the filling, turn off the heat, and cover with the pan lid for a couple of minutes. Take a peek inside, and when it's set the way you like it, tilt the skillet over a plate and use a spatula to slide it out.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Hold in a warm oven if you're not eating alone or are already hungry for more and need to make another.</span><br />
