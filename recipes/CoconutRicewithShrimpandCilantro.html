                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 cups rice, sticky, sweet, short grained</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups coconut milk</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 small bunch cilantro leaves</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 limes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">enough to garnish sesame seeds, white and dark</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 bag shrimp without tails, frozen cooked</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Coconut rice:  Prepare rice by soaking sweet short grained rice for at least 3 hours - or overnight.  Figure about 1/3 cup per person.  To cook, simply steam your rice over water.  A rice maker with steamer basket works well or use one of your large pots with a steamer basket/colander inside.  Add hot water to pot just to the point where it ALMOST touches the colander, pour drained and soaked rice into steamer basket, put lid on and steam away.  If using a pot (not a rice maker) be sure to check every 15 minutes that there is still water in the bottom of the pot, we don't want to burn the lovely rice.  The rice should take anywhere from 1/2 an hour to 40 minutes.  To tell the rice is done, remove the lid, grab a fork and dig into the middle of the rice pile, taste a kernel, done?</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">When rice is tender, remove rice and place in a large bowl.  Now you will add the coconut milk, salt and lime zest.  In class we make rice for 14 (6 cups sweet short grained rice) and add 2 cups of coconut milk.  If you want to make rice for 7 use 3 cups rice and 1 cup coconut milk.  If you want rice for 4 I'd go with 2 cups of rice and add about 1/2 cup coconut milk.  BUT, if you are feeling like a Hipcook and want to forgo the measuring tools just slowly add and stir in the coconut milk to the point where the rice looks a little creamier but NOT runny!  Then salt to taste and add  some lime zest too.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Serve immediately or you can spread the rice out onto a cookie sheet, place in an oven and 1/2 hour before serving warm rice on low heat (200F).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Coconut Rice with shrimp and cilantro:  When your coconut rice is cool enough to handle, form into little flat balls, dip in sesame seeds (Thai markets carry both white and dark sesame seeds) to coat the bottom and top with shrimp and cilantro.  You can purchase frozen cooked shrimp for this – or sauté your own in some veggie oil, chopped garlic and chopped Thai chili, toward the end give the shrimpies a squeeze of lime juice.  Taste.</span><br />
