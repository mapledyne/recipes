<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/4 cups sugar, granulated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 eggs, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 teaspoons lemon juice, fresh</span><br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Crust:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a bowl, mix together graham cracker, sugar and butter until well moistened. Press into the bottom of and slightly up the sides of a lightly greased 10 inch springform pan. Bake in a 325 degree oven until firm, about 12 - 15 minutes. Let cool completely.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Whisk egg white with 2 teaspoons of water until foamy, drizzle over crust, swirling pan to coat bottom and side. If necessary use pastry brush to spread. Bake in 325 degree oven until crust appears dry, 7 - 10 minutes. Let cool completely. (This step may seem finicky but it prevents the filling from turning the crust soggy).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Filling:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">While crust is cooling, in a large bowl beat cream cheese until fluffy. Gradually beat in sugar and continue to beat, scraping down the side of the bowl twice, until smooth and light. On low speed beat in eggs, one at a time. scraping down the side of the bowl often, just until combined. Stir in lemon juice, vanilla and salt; stir in sour cream in 2 additions until smooth. Pour over crust, smoothing top.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bake in 275 degree oven until surface is no longer shiny and outer 2 inches of cheesecake appear set, yet center is still jiggly - 1.75 - 2 hours. Turn off oven, let it cool in the oven for 1 hour. Remove from oven, quickly run pairing knife around edge of cheesecake. Let cool completely. Refrigerate until chilled, about 6 hours. (Make ahead - cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days).</span><br />
