                <span itemprop="description">
	‘Tis the season of the hostess gift! This chocolate-scented jam is particularly lovely on warm scones, brioche, or toast. Just before canning, let a spoonful of the jam cool on a plate and taste it. You can drop in an extra ounce or two of chocolate if you’re so inclined. 

Before you begin, if you aren’t already familiar with jam making, review the instructions and make sure you have the necessary equipment (including enough sterilized jars and lids).

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 flat (6 full half-pint baskets 2 ½ to 3 pounds)) raspberries</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup (one 1.75-ounce packet) pectin, powdered</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon cocoa powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 to 4 tablespoons   (from about 1 large lemon) lemon juice, freshly squeezed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">7 cups (3 pounds) sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 ounces dark chocolate, Theo 85 percent, finely chopped</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Put the raspberries in a large, heavy-bottomed pot and use a potato masher to squash them. Add the pectin, cocoa powder, and lemon juice, and stir thoroughly so that the pectin doesn’t clump.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, then stir in the sugar. Bring the mixture back up to a full boil and let it boil vigorously for exactly 1 minute. Remove the pot from the heat and let it settle for 5 minutes. Skim any foam that has accumulated, then add the chopped chocolate and let the jam sit for another 2 minutes to melt it. Use a whisk to blend the jam and chocolate until perfectly smooth. Ladle the still-hot jam into sterilized jars, wipe the rims carefully with a clean towel to remove any spills, and screw a lid onto each jar, but don’t over tighten.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">You can process the jars in a water bath, a pressure canner, or the oven. We use a water bath. With a batch this size, it’s easiest to do with a real canning pot. If you don’t have a canning pot, you can make one by filling your largest pot with water (enough to come up an inch above the jars). Place a folded kitchen towel at the bottom. Bring the water to a full boil. Use tongs to carefully lower the jars so they stand on the towel, cover the pot, and bring it back up to a boil. Boil the jars for 10 minutes (if your boiling water was ready when you finished making the jam, and the jam is still piping hot, you can boil them for 5 minutes). Use tongs to very carefully remove the hot jars from the water, and let them cool to room temperature sitting on a towel. Your jam will keep for one year.</span><br />
