                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	If you’ve never had pea shoots (豆苗 dou miao), then you should immediately head to your local Asian supermarket and pick up a bag of these bright green vegetables. This is my favorite side dish at Chinese restaurants and while it’s often not part of the menu because of its seasonal nature, I always ask for it. And, when they’re available fresh at the market, it's easy make this dish at home. 

Preparing these pea shoots is simple. The bottom of the stem can be tough, so I rip it off right at the base of the first leaf. Sometimes the pea shoot can be rather long: Tear them in half to make two shorter pieces, if you like. Rinse the pea shoots in cold water and then drain completely. This is a very quick stir fry: It won’t take long for the pea shoots to begin to wilt and turn bright green. They will be juicy, tender, but still crunchy.
