                <span itemprop="description">
	Roasted fish is the key to zen fish tacos. By roasting, you can control the speed of cooking and keep the fish moist. Lost crunch from the frying can be made up for with pickled red onion (I usually make a huge batch and then use the leftovers for lunches and any other excuse I can find). The onions get a bowl, as does the avocado, which turns out to be conveniently soft and sliceable by 7-year-olds. Cilantro sprigs and lime -- I put them in a pile right on the countertop for serving -- and Cholula hot sauce on the table make up the rest of it. 

If I make the onions ahead of time, I can have fish tacos ready in 15 minutes. While the fish, rubbed with cumin and ground ancho chile powder, roasts, I clean the cilantro and toast the corn tortillas in a dry pan. My kids slice the avocado and my husband pours lemonade and opens beers. You can guess who gets what.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 onion, red</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 part water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 parts vinegar, cider</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 pound fish, white (such as pollack or hake or similar)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon cumin, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon chile, ground ancho or chipotle</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon olive oil, extra-virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 avocado, , cut into 1/8-inch slices lengthwise</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 bunch cilantro, washed and dried</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 limes, each cut into 6 wedges</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 tortillas, flour or corn</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Hot sauce of your choice, (optional)</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Slice the onions very thinly and put them in a microwaveable container. Add the salt and sugar. Cover everything with 1 part water to 2 parts vinegar.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Microwave for 1 minute, stir, and microwave for another minute. Cool, then refrigerate overnight (if you have time).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Heat the oven to 350° F. Season the fish with salt, then the cumin and chile. Lay the fish in a baking dish, and sprinkle with the olive oil.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Meanwhile, set out the pickled onions. Slice the avocado and put it in a bowl (I like to squeeze a little lime juice over it so it doesn’t brown). Wash and dry the cilantro and pile it on your counter. Do the same with the lime wedges.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. When the oven is hot, bake the fish until just cooked through, about 10 minutes. While the fish roasts, place a large skillet over medium high heat. Add as many tortillas as you can – probably just 2 – and toast for a minute or two on each side, just enough to warm through and leave a light toasting mark; be careful not to let them dry out. Keep the warm tortillas piled under a clean tea towel.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. When the fish is ready, serve it with the warm tortillas and all the fixins, and let everyone have at it, making their own dream fish tacos.</span><br />
