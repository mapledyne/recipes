	I first had a potato pizza a few years when I lived in Tampa at this great cafe by my office in St. Petersburg. This recipe was inspired by that pizza. It is great as is but if you want to really gild the lily top it with a drizzle of truffle oil and/or a fried egg. After all, everything is better with a little truffle and a runny yummy egg. - melissav (less) â€”melissav

Food52 Review: This an amazing, almost purely white pizza. The fresh ricotta, made simply by heating up three milks until they form tiny curds, is rich and silky and left me vowing never to buy that grainy tub stuff again! The potato is simply boiled, then dressed in olive oil and bits of rosemary. I used the olive oil-perfumed crust recipe from TasteFood and layered on the ricotta, potato, parmesan and pecorino. After baking, I added more fresh ricotta, olive oil, and sea salt. In each bite there was crunchy crust, creamy rich cheese, fragrant potato bits, and little nibs of salt. The runny fried egg, as suggested by melissav, was a very good addition. You might even consider adding pieces of torn prosciutto, snips of sun-dried tomato, or crispy bacon to suit your taste. However, I suggest leaving the all white pizza white... and adding more luscious ricotta because it is oh so good.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 ounces pizza dough</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup ricotta, fresh, plus a few spoonfuls for finishing</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup potato, yukon gold, sliced very thin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon rosemary, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for drizzling</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup cheese, parmesan, grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup cheese, pecorino, grated</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Heat the oven as hot as it goes (500-550) with a pizza stone in the lower third for about 1 hour.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Bring a pot of very salted water to boil and add the sliced potatoes for 5-7 minutes until tender. Drain and return to the pan over low heat to remove the extra moisture. Toss with the olive oil, rosemary, and salt to taste.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Roll out the pizza dough very thin on top of a piece of parchment paper.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Spread with the ricotta and top with the potatoes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Sprinkle the cheese on top. Slide onto the pizza stone, parchment paper and all.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Bake for 10 minutes until golden brown and crisp. If you have a convection oven, I typically turn it on as soon as I put the pizza in the oven.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Remove from oven. Add a few dots of ricotta, drizzle with olive oil, and a sprinkle of good salt.</span><br />
