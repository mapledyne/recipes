                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 Tbsp rosemary, fresh, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 lemon, zest of</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cloves garlic, roughly chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons salt, kosher, Diamond Crystal brand (exact)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon black pepper, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 Tbsp olive oil, extra-virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 Tbsp lemon juice</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 to 2 1/2 pounds chicken thighs, bone-in, skin-on, skin-on</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 Tbsp olive oil, extra-virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 shallots, peeled, halved and peeled</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1 Place the rosemary, lemon zest, chopped garlic, salt, and pepper in a mini-chopper and pulse until well ground. (If you don't have a mini-chopper, just mince the rosemary and garlic very fine, and mix with the rest).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2 Place the chicken thighs in a (non-reactive) bowl and rub all over with the rosemary lemon herb rub. Arrange the thighs skin-side down and sprinkle with the lemon juice. Let marinate for an hour¬†at room temperature, or chill several hours or overnight, and let sit at room temp for an hour before cooking.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3 Preheat oven to 350 ∞F. Heat 2 Tbsp olive oil in a cast iron (10 to 12-inch) or other large relatively stick-free oven-proof skillet (hard anodized aluminum will work well)¬†on medium high to high heat. As soon as the oil is shimmery hot, pat dry the chicken thighs with paper towels and lay them skin-side down in the pan. Sear the thighs without moving them for 3-5 minutes or until nicely browned. Turn the thighs over in the pan so they are skin-side up. Remove the pan from heat.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4 Place garlic cloves and either shallots or onion wedges in between the chicken thigh pieces in the pan. Place in the oven and cook for 20 minutes or until the internal temperature of the chicken thighs reach 175¬∞F.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove from oven.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">As a safety note (having burned my hand in the past), I recommend rubbing an ice cube on the handle of the hot pan as a way to cook it down quickly. Then be sure you keep the handle covered with a pot holder so that someone (including yourself) doesn't inadvertently pick up the pan with the hot handle on their bare hands.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Serve with a side of rice, pasta, bread, or potatoes, or over a bed of baby arugula or spinach leaves for a low carb option.</span><br />
