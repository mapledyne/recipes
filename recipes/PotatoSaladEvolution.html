                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1.75 lbs potatoes, baby</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 tablespoons olive oil, extra virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons lemon juice, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 bunch chives, fresh, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 lemon</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup yogurt, plain, full fat organic preferred, for Em</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">(optional) bacon, smoked or pancetta, thinly sliced</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Bring a pan of salted water to a boil. Peel 1-3/4 pounds of baby potatoes chopping any larger ones in half, leaving the smaller ones whole. When the water is boiling, add the potatoes to the pan and bring back to a boil for about 10-15 minutes, depending on the size of your potatoes. Test them with the point of a knife to make sure they're cooked through. As soon as they're ready, drain them well in a colander and put them into a bowl. The trick is to dress the potatoes while they are still hot - mix 6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and 2 tablespoons of lemon juice in a bowl (zest lemon first if using later in step 3). Season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir well. Toss the hot potatoes in the dressing.  Serve right away, as it is, or move on to the next steps...</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Finely chop a small bunch of fresh chives and sprinkle them over the potatoes. Toss well before serving.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Toss the dressed potato salad and chives with the zest of 1 lemon and 1/4 cup of yogurt.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Put a frying pan on the heat and add a splash of olive oil. Thinly cut slices of smoked bacon or pancetta into small pieces and add to the pan. Toss and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the bacon is crispy and golden. Remove from the heat.  Sprinkle over your potato salad and serve.</span><br />
