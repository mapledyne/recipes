                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 small or 1 medium shallot, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 medium garlic clove, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 tablespoons vinegar, red wine</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup olive oil, extra-virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/8 teaspoon sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">a good pinch salt, sea</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 basil leaves, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 large tomatoes, beefsteak</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 or 2 handfuls tomatoes, cherry or grape</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 ear corn on the cob, kernels cut off</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">to taste salt, flaky</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">a few basil leaves, fresh</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Make the Vinagrette:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Stir together the shallots, garlic and vinegar in a small bowl. Set aside for 1 hour - or even a couple of hours if you have time. You want to soften the garlic and shallot to no longer taste raw and be slightly pickled.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Whisk in the olive oil, sugar and salt. Add the basil leaves, bashing them with a whisk to bruise them and release their oils. Let sit for another 30 minutes. Before using, remove and discard the basil leaves and taste for salt.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Assemble the Salad:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Slice the tomatoes into 1/2 inch thick rounds. Arrange them on a platter. Halve the cherry tomatoes and strew them around the tomato slices. Scatter the raw corn kernels on top. Season with a good pinch of flaky salt. Spoon the vinaigrette liberally over the whole platter 1/4 cup won't be too much - you'll want extra for eating with bread - and then snip the basil leaves into strips over the top.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Vinagrette will keep for 3 days (before garlic and shallot taste too strong).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Serve with buttery scrambled eggs, chewy bread and a wedge of sharp cheddar cheese.</span><br />
