                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	I also made a batch with 2 tablespoons less sugar and we found them more enjoyably bittersweet; feel free to do the same if that’s your preference. These contain an unconscionable amount of butter and we shouldn’t question it; this isn’t the time for it. Someone is going to ask me if they can frost these. You may not. These are such a perfect self-contained luxury, save the frosting for some arid sheet cake that needs it. If you serve it with anything, my suggestion would be a dollop of barely sweetened whipped cream, a dusting of powdered sugar and/or some berries.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">7 ounces chocolate, bittersweet (70 or 72%), roughly chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">14 tablespoons butter, unsalted, cut into chunks</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup sugar, granulated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon salt, fine sea</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 eggs, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon flour, all-purpose</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place chocolate and butter in a large heatproof bowl. Either over a saucepan of simmering water or in the microwave in 15- to 30-second bursts, stirring frequently, melt the two together. Off the heat, whisk in sugar, which should cool the mixture down significantly. Whisk in salt, then eggs, one at a time. Stir in flour.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. The batter will thicken a bit as it stands.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat oven to 325°F (165°C).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Either coat a 12-cup muffin tin with nonstick spray or line it with cupcake papers. Spoon batter halfway into each cup and bake for 25 to 30 minutes (20 minutes in the mini-tart pans I show), or until a toothpick inserted into the center of cakelets comes out batter-free. (Fudgy crumbs are to be expected.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Let cool on a rack for 5 to 10 minutes before unmolding. Puffed tops will fall a little as they cool.</span><br />
