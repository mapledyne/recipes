                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons (15 grams) sesame seeds</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound (455 grams) lamb, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2/3 cup (40 grams) breadcrumbs, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup (60 ml) water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon salt, table, iodized</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 eggs, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 garlic cloves, minced or pressed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon cumin, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon coriander, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon pepper, aleppo</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">pinch cayenne or red pepper flakes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">olive oil, extra virgin, for cooking</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Preheat the oven to 425°F. Line a rimmed sheet pan with parchment.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Put the sesame seeds in a small skillet, and place the skillet over medium heat.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until the seeds smell toasty and are beginning to turn golden.  I never pay attention to exactly how long this takes, but it’s not terribly long.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">While the sesame seeds toast, put the lamb through cayenne in a medium bowl.  When they’re ready, add the toasted sesame seeds.  Mix with a fork (or with your hand, my preference) until evenly mixed. Form the meat mixture into 1½-inch, or golf-ball-sized, balls.  (This is easiest to do if your hands are wet; that will help to keep the meat from sticking to you.) Arrange them on the prepared sheet pan.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">At this point, put the sheet pan in the oven and walk away. After about 10 minutes, pull out your thermometer (all hail the Thermapen! Possibly my single favorite kitchen tool!) and poke one or two of the meatballs: when they’re ready, the internal temperature will be between 160 and 165 degrees.  If they’re not hot enough, slide them back in, and check again shortly. Again, I never seem to keep track of how long they take to cook. Somewhere between 12 and 15 minutes, I think?</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Yield: about 4 servings, or roughly 25 meatballs</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Note: These meatballs freeze beautifully.  I like to cook about half of them right away and then freeze the remaining half on a sheet pan lined with parchment.  When they’re frozen solid, I transfer them from the pan to a plastic storage bag. They thaw quickly - and actually, I’ve even baked them while they were still slightly frozen. It took a bit longer, but no harm done.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Deb serves hers with a smashed-chickpea salad that’s bright with sumac and lemon, and the combination is delicious. I like them with anything, though most often a pile of roasted vegetables. They would be perfect with couscous, or stuffed in a pita with shredded cabbage and chopped cucumber and some yogurt or tahini sauce, or even just heaped on plain rice with a cucumber salad on the side.  The main thing to know is, they would be perfect.</span><br />
