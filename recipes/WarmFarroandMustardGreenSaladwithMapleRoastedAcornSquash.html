	This salad contains a perfect balance of sweet and salty. Enjoy it as a meal, or serve it as a side. 

Tip: If possible, soak the farro for a few hours to speed up the cooking process, then drain before you cook it. (less)

 —Nicole Franzen

Food52 Review: WHO: Nicole Franzen is a food and lifestyle photographer from Brooklyn, NY. 
WHAT: A bitter farro salad, sweetened slightly by maple syrup and acorn squash. 
HOW: Toss warm farro with mustard greens, lemon juice, and olive oil. Serve with maple-roasted acorn squash, feta cheese, and toasted walnuts. 
WHY WE LOVE IT: This salad includes everything we want to eat in the fall, but it also translates well to any season -- the lemon brightens it for summer, while the combination of the warm farro with mustard greens makes it hearty enough for colder weather. If you want to bolster it further, trying adding root vegetables like beets or an additional protein, like salmon, on top.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups farro</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Sea salt, to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 bay leaf</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 acorn squash</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons maple syrup</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Vegetable oil, to cook</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Pepper, to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Juice of 1 lemon</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more if needed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 bunch mustard greens</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese, to serve</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup chopped walnuts, toasted, to serve</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. To cook the farro, place it in a saucepan with a sprinkle of sea salt, a bay leaf, and enough water to cover the farro completely. Cover the pan and bring the water to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook until tender, 20 to 45 minutes, making sure to add water if needed.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. While the farro cooks, preheat the oven to 375º F. Slice the acorn squash in half, and discard any seeds and guts. Cut into 1/4-inch slices and place on a sheet pan. Add the maple syrup and a drizzle of vegetable oil. Toss well and season with salt and pepper. Place in the oven and bake until tender and lightly browned, about 30 to 45 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. For the dressing, whisk together the lemon juice with an equal amount of olive oil so that you have a half acid, half oil ratio. (This ratio allows for the citrus to stand out against the richness of the farro and the greens.) Season the dressing with salt and pepper, to taste. Dress the farro and mustard greens, toss well. Serve farro salad with the roasted acorn squash, feta cheese, and toasted walnuts on top. Nom!</span><br />
