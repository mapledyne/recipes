	Author Notes: This my favorite, favorite chicken salad. I love the crunch of the cornichons and radishes and how the mayonnaise smooths out their flavors a bit. {That being said, I'm kind of a pickle/cornichon/gerkhin fanatic. I could eat those suckers on their own all day long.} Buying a roasted chicken just makes the recipe easier for me, and I like being able to have both white and dark meat in the chicken salad. {It also gives me an excuse to make chicken stock.} Of course, you can use whatever method you like to cook the chicken and whatever parts of the chicken you prefer. Again, just makes life a little easier. (less) â€”theicp

Food52 Review: This isn't the chicken salad that you're used to tasting at parties, with the usual ingredients and a container of mayonnaise. Here, the radishes and cornichons add an inviting crunch. The tartness of the cornichons lingers nicely, and is met with the champagne vinegar and mayonnaise mixture, which brings all the flavors alive. The recipe, brightened by fresh chives and tarragon, inspires me to host a wine & cheese party, with local cheeses, fruit, and warm flatbread alongside this salad.
