                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	Chhole and chana masala are used interchangeably for the Indian dish of spiced garbanzo beans that's popular in Indian restaurants. But there is a slight difference between the two: Chana Masala is the drier version, eaten with naan, puris, and bhatura (deep-fried bread), whereas chhole is the saucier dish generally eaten with rice.

<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 bay leaf</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 pieces cinnamon sticks, 1/2-inch long</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups onion, red, finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons ginger, finely grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 garlic cloves, medium, peeled and crushed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 chile pepper, green, diced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups tomatoes, diced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pinch sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons coriander powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 teaspoons mango powder (amchoor), dry or 1 teaspoon lemon juice</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">rice, brown, to serve</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. This recipe gives instructions for using dry garbanzo beans as well as canned garbanzo beans. Only the following step differs.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. For dried beans: Add the soaked beans to a heavy-bottomed pan and cover with 6 cups of water. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and 2 black cardamom pods, then bring the water to a boil, cover the pot, and cook for 1 hour over medium heat. After boiling, drain the garbanzo beans and save the water. Set aside. For canned beans: Drain and rinse the beans. Add them to heavy-bottomed pot along with 4 cups of water, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 2 black cardamom pots. Bring the water to a boil, cover the pot, and cook for 15 minutes over medium heat. Drain the beans and save the water. Set aside. Though boiling canned beans seems like an extra step, I do it to remove the canned, metallic taste of the beans and to impart a creamy texture.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Place a heavy-bottomed sauté pan on one of the stove burners and pour in the oil. Turn the heat onto medium and when the oil is hot, slide green cardamom, bay leaf, and cinnamon pieces into the pan. Sauté for 3 to 4 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Add onions and allow them to become translucent and brown at the edges, about 7 to 8 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Follow with garlic, ginger, and green chile pepper and sauté for 2 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Pour tomatoes and add pinch of sugar. Stir from time to time, letting the tomatoes lose their moisture. Once they've gotten to that point, stir continuously to prevent them from sticking to the pan. Soon the tomatoes will start secreting oil. This whole process from adding tomatoes to secreting oil should take about 10 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Add turmeric, coriander powder, and remaining salt. Sauté for 3 to 4 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">8. Add garbanzo beans and 2 cups water reserved from boiling the beans (if water saved from boiling is not enough, supplement with regular water).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">9. Add dry mango powder, also called amchoor. It's generally found in Asian grocery stores. If you are not able to find it, substitute with 1 teaspoon of lemon juice.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">10. Let simmer for 10 minutes. Serve hot with rice or warm naan.</span><br />
