<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 to 1 pound mushrooms, wild, cleaned if necessary and torn or sliced into smaller pieces if thick (small wild mushrooms should be</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 garlic cloves, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons thyme leaves, fresh or sage, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups rice, arborio or carnaroli</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup white wine, dry, such as pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup peas, frozen, thawed (optional)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup parmesan cheese, or a mixture of Parmesan and Pecorino Romano</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Bring stock or broth to a simmer in a saucepan, with a ladle nearby. Make sure stock is well seasoned, and keep it simmering on the stove.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Heat oil in a wide, heavy nonstick skillet or saucepan over medium heat. Add onions or shallots and cook gently until just tender, 3 to 5 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Turn up heat and add mushrooms. Cook, stirring, until they begin to sweat, about 3 minutes, then add garlic and thyme or sage. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Season mushrooms with salt and pepper and continue to cook over medium heat until they are soft. Taste and adjust seasoning.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Add rice and stir until grains begin to crackle. Add wine and cook, stirring, until wine is no longer visible in pan. Stir in enough simmering stock to just cover the rice. The stock should bubble slowly. Cook, stirring often and vigorously, until stock is just about absorbed. Add another ladleful or two of stock and continue cooking, not too fast and not too slowly, stirring often and adding more stock when rice is almost dry, for 15 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Add peas, if using, and continue adding stock and stirring for another 10 minutes. Rice should be tender all the way through but still al dente. Taste now and adjust seasoning.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Add another ladleful or two of stock to rice. Stir in parsley and Parmesan, and remove from heat. Season with black pepper and serve right away in wide soup bowls or on plates.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Note</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Advance preparation: You can begin up to several hours before serving: proceed with the recipe and cook halfway through Step 4, for about 10 minutes. The rice should still be hard in the middle when you remove it from the heat, and there should not be any liquid in the pan. Spread it in an even layer in the pan or on a baking sheet and keep it away from the heat until you resume cooking. 15 minutes before serving, resume cooking as instructed.</span><br />
