                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 12-ounce package raspberries, frozen</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 cup, divided 1/2 cup and and 1/4 cup sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">10 Oreo cookies, without the filling, or 20 chocolate wafer cookies</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 Tbsp butter, melted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces cream cheese, room temperature</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">pinch of salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup sour cream, full fat</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Whipped cream for topping</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Fresh raspberries for garnish</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 8-ounce mason jars, wide-mouthed</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1 Set aside 1/2 a cup of the frozen raspberries from the package. With the remaining raspberries, place them in a medium saucepan. Add 1/2 cup sugar and 1/3 cup of water. Bring to a simmer on medium high heat, then lower the heat to maintain the simmer, and gently cook, whisking¬†frequently, until the raspberries have completely broken down, about 10 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">If you want, strain the raspberry sauce through a sieve to remove the seeds, and then return the sauce to the pan and continue to gently simmer until the the sauce is syrupy. Set aside to cool.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2 Grind the chocolate cookie wafers (Oreo or other brand) in a food processor, mini chopper, or by placing in a plastic bag and crushing with a rolling pin, until finely ground.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place in a medium bowl and stir in the melted butter. Divide evenly among the mason jars, packing the chocolate "crust" at the bottom of each mason jar in a layer about 1/4 to 1/3-inch thick.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">At this point you can put in a 350¬∞F oven for 10 minutes to bake the crust in, which will make it easier to pour in the cheesecake filling without it mixing in with the crust. (Or if you don't care if the bottom is a little messy, you can skip this part.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3 In a mixer, beat the cream cheese on medium speed for 4 minutes, until smooth and light. Add 1/4 cup of sugar and beat 4 minutes more. Add a pinch of salt and the egg, and beat another minute.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add the sour cream and beat another minute, until smooth. Add 1/4 cup of the cooled raspberry syrup from step one, and beat until incorporated.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4¬†Place the reserved raspberries on top of the chocolate crusts in the mason jars in a single layer. Pour the raspberry cheesecake filling over the raspberries in the jars.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5 Place in a roasting pan and add about an inch of boiling water to the pan to create a water bath, which will help the cheesecakes cook more evenly. Bake at 325¬∞F for 40 minutes. Then turn off the heat in the oven and let the cheesecakes continue to gently cook in the residual heat of the oven for another 30 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6 Remove from oven and let cool to room temp. Chill for at least a half hour before eating. Don't worry if there are cracks on the surface of the cheesecakes. Top with the remaining raspberry sauce, whipped cream, and fresh raspberries.</span><br />
