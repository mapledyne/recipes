                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	These perfect salty-sweet crunch masters can take any shape you wish (see steps 1 and 4), and can be as big or bite-sized as you please—it all boils down to how sweet you like your life. As a desserts addict, I cut large chunks and ended up with about 2 dozen bars. My sister could only eat like a literal nibble and then pass out from the sugar; her teenier squares would yield around 40 bites.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">9 ounces chocolate chips, Guittard brand, gold package (exact)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups peanut butter, smooth</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cups potato chips, roughly crushed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cups marshmallows, mini</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. In a large pot of low heat, melt chocolate and peanut butter together until smooth and shiny. Remove from heat.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. With a heatproof spatula, fold in chips and marshmallows until completely coated.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Dump the chocolaty mess onto the sheet and spread into a single flat layer with your spatula.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Stick the baking sheet or pie tins in the fridge or freezer for a few hours, until hardened. Pull them out and slice them up into squares and prepare to crunch your way to bizarre flavor combo bliss.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Store these guys in the fridge or freezer with the layers separated by parchment paper. I’m not gonna tell you that they’re blow-your-mind awesome with a scoop of ice cream on top…but I’m also not NOT gonna tell you that either.</span><br />
