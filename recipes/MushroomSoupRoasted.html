                <span itemprop="description">
	I was never a fan of mushroom soup until I created this recipe. I thought I would try roasting the mushrooms to give them a great depth of flavor and partly because I love any vegetable that's roasted. The result was just that, hearty and delicious with a great flavor from the roasted mushrooms. And now it's a staple in my house!

<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons olive oil, extra virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">black pepper, freshly ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups beef stock, low-sodium</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon butter, unsalted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 shallot, thinly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt, to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 small clove garlic, finely minced</span><br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Preheat oven to 425°F. Place mushrooms on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Season with pepper and roast for 15-20 minutes, until softened. Transfer to a blender (reserving 1 tablespoon of mushrooms for garnish), along with 1/2 cup stock and purée until smooth.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Meanwhile, in a medium sauté pan, heat butter over medium heat. Add shallot and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add garlic and thyme and cook for another 1-2 minutes. Deglaze pan with wine and cook for 1-2 minutes. Stir in flour until incorporated, about 2 minutes. Add puréed mushroom mixture to pan, along with remaining 1 1/2 cups stock and cream to bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10-15 minutes until soup is thickened and warmed through. Top with reserved mushrooms and a sprig of thyme and serve warm.</span><br />
