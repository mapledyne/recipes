                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	Just to note, this is no Starbucks gingerbread loaf. It is not mild or docile in any way; this is for that family member who loves old-school, intense gingerbread cakes and complains that they don’t make them like they use to. Or, it’s for people like me, who didn’t even know she liked gingerbread before trying it.

The only snafu I ran into with this recipe is that the cake sunk a bit. Since it was in a bundt pan (flipped upside-down for serving) no one will be the wiser, but I suspect if the problem is anything like the sinking honey cake, there might be too much baking powder in it. You’ll only want to consider dialing it back a pinch if you are subdividing it into a pan that you won’t serve upside down.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup beer, oatmeal stout or Guinness Stout</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup molasses, dark (not blackstrap)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon baking soda</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons ginger, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon cinnamon, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon cloves, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, freshly grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Pinch of ground cardamom, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 eggs, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup packed brown sugar, dark</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup sugar, granulated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 cup vegetable oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">for dusting sugar, confectioners'</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">for topping cream, whipped, (optional)</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Preheat oven to 350°F. Generously butter bundt pan and dust with flour, knocking out excess. (She is not kidding about this. I used a nonstick pan with a butter/flour spray and still lost a chunk of cake. I will be more generous next time.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring stout and molasses to a boil in a large saucepan and remove from heat. Whisk in baking soda, then cool to room temperature.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Sift together flour, baking powder, and spices in a large bowl. Whisk together eggs and sugars. Whisk in oil, then molasses mixture. Add to flour mixture and whisk until just combined.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Pour batter into bundt pan and rap pan sharply on counter to eliminate air bubbles. Bake in middle of oven until a tester comes out with just a few moist crumbs adhering, about 50 minutes. Cool cake in pan on a rack 5 minutes. Turn out onto rack and cool completely.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Serve cake, dusted with confectioners sugar, with whipped cream.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Do ahead: This gingerbread is better if made a day ahead. It will keep 3 days, covered, at room temperature. I am sure it will keep well-wrapped in the freezer even longer.</span><br />
