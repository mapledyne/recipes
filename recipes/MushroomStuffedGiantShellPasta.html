                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 pasta, jumbo shell</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup mushrooms, white</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup mushrooms, chanterelle</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup mushrooms, oyster</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 onions, separated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cloves garlic</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">A few springs of parsley, as desired</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 chile, seeded</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon olive oil, extra-virgin, plus more as needed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Juice of 1/2 lemon, divided</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt and pepper, to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup cream</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup Parmesan, grated, plus more as desired</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Cook the pasta according to the package, but reduce the cooking time by 1 minute so that they are al dente. Preheat the oven to 360ยบ F (160ยบ C).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Meanwhile, clean the mushrooms and peel the garlic and onion. Roughly chop the mushrooms and onions. Finely dice the garlic, parsley, and chile.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Heat a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, 1/2 of the onion, and the garlic. Fry for 1 minute. Add the mushrooms, chile, and salt and pepper to taste. Fry for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, and add 1/2 of the lemon juice and the parsley. Add more lemon juice if preferred, or discard it (or save the rest for another recipe). Remove the mushroom mixture from the pan and set aside on a plate.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon of olive oil to the pan and add the other 1/2 of the onion. Fry for 1 minute. Pour in the cream, add salt and pepper to taste, and stir occasionally. Cook for 3 minutes. (If you used milk to dilute the cream, you might want to add a bit of flour or corn starch to make the sauce a bit thicker.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Meanwhile, fill the al dente shells with the mushroom mix and place in an ovenproof dish. Pour the cream over the shells and sprinkle the Parmesan on top. Place the dish in the oven and bake for about 15 minutes, until the cheese turns golden brown. Serve with a few sprinkles of chopped parsley.</span><br />
