                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	This is the recipe that turned me—a self-professed disliker of spaghetti squash—into a fan. Most of the credit goes to the slightly spicy, garlicky white bean and tomato ragout, but the squash really is a perfect counterpart, offering sweetness and softness to the dish.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 large whole squash, spaghetti</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt and pepper to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Garlic powder, to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 onion, white or yellow, diced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cloves garlic, minced (adjust to taste)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon thyme, crushed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon oregano, dried</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 dash red pepper flakes, crushed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">One 14 1/2-ounce can tomatoes, fire-roasted diced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">One 8-ounce can tomato sauce</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups beans, cooked cannellini, navy, or Great Northern beans (or 1 can white beans), drained and rinsed)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon organic sugar, or 2 teaspoons maple syrup</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">parsley, fresh, chopped</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. To prepare the squash, preheat your oven to 375° F. Use a sharp knife to trim the top and bottom of the squash off, so that it can stand upright on a cutting board. Slice the squash in half lengthwise. Scrape out the seeds with a large spoon.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Line a baking sheet with parchment or foil. Brush the inside of the squash with the olive oil and sprinkle with kosher or coarse salt and pepper to taste. Place the squash, cut side down, on the baking sheet. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the squash skin is tender enough to pierce easily with a fork. Allow the squash to cool down enough to handle, and then use a fork to scrape out the flesh into a mixing bowl. Taste the squash and add more salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. While the squash roasts, make the ragout. Heat the olive oil in a medium pot over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring often, until the onion is soft and translucent. Add the garlic. Sauté the onion and garlic for another 2 minutes, adding a splash of water if the onions are sticking. Add the thyme, oregano, salt, pepper, tomatoes, tomato sauce, beans, and sugar to the pot and stir them well. Bring the mixture to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 10 minutes, uncovered, or until the sauce has thickened up. Taste sauce and add seasonings as desired.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. To serve, place a quarter of the squash into each bowl or plate and top with a cup of the ragout, as well as a bit of chopped parsley.</span><br />
