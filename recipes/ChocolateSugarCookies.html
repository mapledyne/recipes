                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	"I often find myself craving a piece of chocolate in the afternoons, s it goes rather with the cup of hot coffee that is also a necessity in my daily life. Most days a little sure of bittersweet will do, but other times something more extravagant is essential. I found these chocolate sugar cookies to do the trick; they are soft and delicious without being overly rich and sweet."

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 3/4 cups flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup cocoa powder, unsweetened</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 teaspoon baking soda</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup butter, unsalted, room temperature</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 3/4 cups sugar, (plus 1 cup | 200 g  for rolling)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon vanilla extract, pure</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon cardamom, ground, (optional)</span><br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Adjust an oven rack to the middle position. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle, beat the butter on medium until smooth. Add the 1¾ cups sugar and beat on medium until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla and beat on medium until combined. Add the flour mixture and beat on low until just combined.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place the remaining 1 cup sugar in a medium bowl. Stir in cardamom, if desired.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Form the cookies into 3-ounce | 85 g balls (a scant ⅓ cup each). Roll each ball in the sugar and place 6 cookies on each prepared sheet pan. Bake one sheet at a time 11 to 14 minutes, until the edges have set and the centers are puffed and starting to crackle.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Transfer the baking sheet to a wire rack and let the cookies cool completely on the pan.</span><br />
