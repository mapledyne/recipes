                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	This is such a festive dish! I have a real shortcut for you. Rather than reduce fresh pomegranate juice, just use a few spoons of pomegranate molasses. You can find it on- line or in markets that sell Persian products. I’ve also seen it in Whole Foods. It’s simply pomegranate juice that has been reduced until it is almost as thick as honey. It’s sweet and tart and has all sorts of fun uses in the kitchen. Bon appetite !

This makes a great side dish for Thanksgiving or any fall meal.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup pomegranate juice</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2/3 cup vinegar, balsamic</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons sugar, brown</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 pounds Brussels sprouts</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 to 2/3 cup pomegranate arils</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Make the glaze: Combine the pomegranate juice, balsamic vinegar, and brown sugar in a saucepan and bring to boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and let the liquid simmer for 25 to 30 minutes, until reduced to a syrupy glaze that coats the spoon. Stir occasionally. You should have about 2/3 cup of pomegranate balsamic glaze when done. (Once cool, store the glaze in the refrigerator for up to a month.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Preheat oven to 375F. Move the oven racks to the upper third and lower third positions. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Roast the Brussels sprouts: Trim the ends of the Brussels sprouts and slice them in half. Chop very large sprouts into quarters. Toss with the olive oil and a good pinch of salt. Divide the sprouts between 2 baking sheets and roast for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring halfway through.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Toss the sprouts with the glaze: Let the Brussels sprouts cool for a few minutes before tossing them with 2 to 3 tablespoons of the pomegranate balsamic reduction and the pomegranate arils. Taste and add more glaze if you like. Serve immediately.</span><br />
