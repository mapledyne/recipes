                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	After significantly reducing the sugar and replacing frozen concentrate with fresh juice, I halved this recipe so that it serves 8 people (in 1-cup servings; your punch glasses may be smaller) from 4 cups concentrate and about 5 cups ice. The resulting punch is lightly sweet and very refreshing. And it crunches. You can definitely double it for a crowd. If you would rather make the slush the way originally recommended, after you make the punch base mixture, add 2 cups cold water to it. Pour mixture into a gallon-sized freezer bag. Freeze mixture until slushy (this might take several to many hours), and serve. If it freezes solid, place it in a punch bowl and let it thaw, breaking it up every 15 minutes or so. Blending ice cubes as directed below is definitely less work.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup bourbon</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup sugar, granulated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups orange juice (about 3 well-squeezed oranges)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 tablespoons lemon juice (about 2 lemons)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">16 to 17 ounces (about 5 cups ice cubes, of small pieces of ice)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">for garnish Mint sprigs or lemon slices</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Boil 1 cup water for tea. Add the tea bags and let steep until cool. Discard the tea bags and set aside. Pour tea into a pitcher. Add bourbon, sugar, orange juice and lemon juice and refrigerate until needed. Don’t worry about stirring the sugar so that it dissolves; after 30 minutes in the fridge, it will have.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">To serve: Shake or stir punch base to ensure ingredients are evenly distributed. To make two liters of punch, add base and full amount of ice cubes to your blender, blending until the ice is crushed and slushy. For each individual glass of punch, place 1/2 cup punch base and slightly heaped 1/2 cup small pieces of ice (mine were chipped off an ice block; don’t ask) and blend until slushy. Add an extra whole ice cube or two to glasses if desired. Garnish glass with a sprig of mint or slice of lemon.</span><br />
