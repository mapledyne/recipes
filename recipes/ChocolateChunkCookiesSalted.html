                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	The version I originally made from the Not Without Salt site called for light brown sugar, says you can bake the dough right away and calls for 8 ounces of chocolate. The version in the (excellent) Date Night In book calls for dark brown sugar, says the dough is best after resting in the fridge for a day or two, and calls for only 6 ounces of chocolate. The good news: both versions work perfectly, but I must insist you use the full half-pound (8 ounces) of chocolate.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup butter, unsalted, at room temperature</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons sugar, granulated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons sugar, turbinado (aka Sugar in the Raw; you can use more brown or white if you don’t have this, but the subtle crunch it adds is delightful)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons packed sugar, dark brown</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 eggs, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon vanilla extract</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 teaspoon baking soda</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Heaped 1/4 teaspoon salt, fine sea or table</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 3/4 cups flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 pound chocolate, semi- or bittersweet, cut into roughly 1/2-inch chunks with a serrated knife</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">flaky salt, to finish</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat oven to 360°F (180°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicon baking mat.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugars together with an electric mixer until very light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add egg and vanilla, beating until incorporated, and scraping down the bowl as needed. Beat in salt fine sea or table salt and baking soda until combined, then the flour on a low speed until just mixed. The dough will look crumbly at this point. With a spatula, fold/stir in the chocolate chunks.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Scoop cookies into 1 1/2 tablespoon (I used a #40 scoop) mounds, spacing them apart on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle each with a few flakes of sea salt. Bake for 11 to 12 minutes, until golden on the outside but still very gooey and soft inside. Out of the oven, let rest on baking sheet out of the for 5 minutes before transferring a cooling rack.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Extra dough — I know, what’s that?! — can be formed into scoops and frozen on a sheet until solid, then transferred to a freezer bag. I’ve baked these right from the freezer; they need, at most, 1 minute more baking time. You could also form them into a 2-inch log, freeze it, and slice and bake the cookies off as desired. The only difference I’ve noted between the cookies baked right away and those baked a day or more later is that the older cookie dough is less puffy when baked.</span><br />
