                <span itemprop="description">
	There’s no fool like a rhubarb fool, and now is the time for it. The arrival of rhubarb in the market always cheers me. Spring is here!
This British dessert goes way back — we’re talking about a few hundred years — and it was originally made with custard and pureed fruits, most notably gooseberries.
I’ve lightened it up with whipped cream instead of the custard and swapped the gooseberries for seasonal rhubarb. It’s an easy-peasy dessert for a weeknight dinner or a spring party!

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup sugar, or more to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 vanilla bean</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound rhubarb stalks, ends trimmed and cut into 1-inch lengths</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 cup cream, heavy whipping</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup sour cream, stirred</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Cook the rhubarb: Place a medium-sized, heat-proof bowl on the counter next to the stove. In a wide, deep skillet over medium heat, stir together the sugar and vanilla bean seeds. Raise the heat to high and add the rhubarb. Cook, stirring constantly, until the rhubarb juices start to flow, the liquid comes to a boil, and the sugar dissolves completely.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook, stirring often, for an additional 4 to 6 minutes, or until the rhubarb starts to fall apart, but about one-third of the chunks remain intact. Taste and add more sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, if you like.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2 Cool the rhubarb: Immediately pour the rhubarb puree into the heatproof bowl. Cool to room temperature; the rhubarb will continue to soften as it sits.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3 Refrigerate the rhubarb for 2 to 3 hours, or until completely chilled. This rhubarb mixture can also be prepared several days in advance and kept refrigerated, or frozen for up to 3 months. (Thaw in the fridge overnight, if frozen.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4 Whip the cream:  In a chilled bowl, whip the cream with an hand mixer or stand mixer until it forms soft peaks but is slightly under-whipped. Whisk in the sour cream just until combined (the cream should still form soft peaks).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4 Assemble the fool:  Add the whipped cream to the bowl of rhubarb. With a rubber spatula, swirl the cream and rhubarb together so that the mixture has streaks of rhubarb, but is not fully mixed. Spoon the fool into tall dessert dishes or wine glasses, and chill until ready to serve.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">The fool is best eaten on the day it is made, but leftovers will keep, covered, for a few days.</span><br />
