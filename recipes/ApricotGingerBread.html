                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon instant yeast</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup plus 2 tablespoons cold water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon ground ginger</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon kosher salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 cup dried apricots, cut into quarters</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. In a big bowl, mix all the ingredients. Stir briefly; do not knead. The mixture will seem very wet and clumpy, which is as it should be.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Cover with a clean, damp dish towel and let the dough rest for 18 hours in a draft-free spot. No need to damped the towel again and don't worry too much about the time; a little more or less makes no difference.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Dust a clean, dry dish towel with flour. Scrape the dough into a round onto the flour. Gently nudge into a ball, and then swaddle in the towel. Let the dough rise for 1-2 hours.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Preheat the over to 475 degrees F with a covered cast-iron Dutch oven instead. I use an oblong 2-quart Le Creuset, though you can use a bigger pan if you like. (The pan does not serve to give the bread shape but to trap heat and steam as the inside of brick oven does, yielding bread with a crunchy, hard crust.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. When the oven reaches 475, open the Dutch oven and carefully slop the dough inside. Cover and bake for 30 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Take the lid off the pot and bake for 15 to 30 minutes more, until, as Lahey writes, the bread "is a deep chestnut color but not burnt." Cool completely before slicing. Store in a paper bag at room temperature for up to a week.</span><br />
