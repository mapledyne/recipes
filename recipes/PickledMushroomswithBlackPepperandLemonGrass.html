                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	This recipe produces fairy-tale worthy mushrooms. Delicate, long, elegant stems with teeny-tiny caps -- believe it or not -- make one hell of a pickle.

Mild-flavored enoki and beech mushrooms are crispy by nature. When they are pickled with lots of coarsely cracked black pepper and a stalk of lemon grass, they become slippery-crisp, with a nubby bite from the peppercorns.

I am addicted to these served a top a Triscuit smeared with cream cheese. But they are equally good on any Asian noodle dish, tucked in a taco or slipped in a burger -- anywhere you are craving a bit of pickle.

Cook to Cook: Enoki and beech mushrooms are sold in spongy clumps. To prep, cut them from the clump and give them a quick rinse. While these delicate mushrooms are beautiful, you can use any variety of mushrooms in this recipe, even giant portobellos. Simply cut them into bite-size pieces before you pickle them.

Mushrooms can be kept refrigerated in their brine up to one month.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 1/2 to 3 cups enoki and beech mushrooms, both brown and white, cut from their clumps, combined, rinsed and gently patted dry</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Brine:</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon peppercorns, black</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon coriander seed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1- to 3-inch piece lemon grass, trimmed and split lengthwise</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup white vinegar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 1/2 teaspoons sea salt, coarse</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 bay leaf</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Gently toss the mushrooms in a large bowl until evenly mixed.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. With a mortar and pestle or in small, sturdy bowl, roughly crush the peppercorns and coriander seed. (Alternately, crush them on a cutting board with the side of a large knife.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Combine the crushed peppercorns, coriander seed, lemon grass, vinegar, water, sugar, salt and bay leaf in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring often, until the sugar is completely dissolved, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Pack the mushrooms in a sterilized, medium jar with a lid (large enough to hold all the mushrooms, or divided into two smaller jars). Carefully pour the hot brine over the mushrooms and allow to cool.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. When cooled, tightly cover the jar and store in the refrigerator. The mushrooms will be ready to eat after 24 hours.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Serve at room temperature or warm slightly and serve on crispy toast, crackers or fresh bread</span><br />
