                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 eggs</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup cheese, parmesan or pecorino</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons olive oil, extra-virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">to taste black pepper, freshly ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 bunch swiss chard, stems torn off, washed, chopped and sauteed</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Sautee the greens.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat a skillet over low heat. Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk very well, until streaks no longer appear. Mix in the cheese, oil, salt and a grind of pepper. Coat the skillet with a film of oil and add the cooked greens, stirring occasionally until they are heated through. Stir the warm greens into the bowl with the egg mixture.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Return the skillet to medium-low heat. Add a coating of oil or butter and pour in the egg mixture, distributing the greens throughout if they're clumping up. Keep the heat low and rotate the skillet a quarter turn occasionally of the egg seems to be cooking unevenly around the edges. When the perimeter of the frittata looks set and the center is still somewhat liquid, about 8 minutes, run a table knife around the side of the skillet to loosen the frittata and carefully slide a metal spatula under it to loosen the underside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Invert a plate over the skillet and take the handle in one hand and put the other on the plate. Here comes the exciting part: you're going to flip the frittata onto the plate. I admit that it can end in disaster, but you have to stay confident and strong! You don't want it to slide onto the plate or fold over, so the motion should be up and over, not just over, and it needs to be fast. Alley-oop and it's on the plate and skillet is clean.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Quickly, before the uncooked egg can overrun the plate, film the skillet with a little more oil, and, with the help of the spatula, encourage the frittata back in. Don't worry if things are looking a little Humpty Dumpty - just fit it all back together again and continue cooking over low heat. When it's cooked through - make a crack in the middle and sneak a peek to see that the egg is all set - turn the frittata out onto the plate.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">The good news is that there are two sides to every frittata - if you don't like the look of one side, flip it over :). Let cool, slice in wedges, and serve.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Variations:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">- Substitute boiled asparagus for greens</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">- Add fresh herbs (parsley, basil, chives, mint or tarragon)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">- Add other boiled vegetables (green beans or sweet peas work well)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">- Little bits of ricotta or goat cheese are nice dabbed into the eggs once in the skillet</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">- Warm leftover pasta in the skillet with a bit of water. When it's warm but before it begins to sizzle, stir in the egg mixture and continue as above.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">- Unsauced spaghetti - fried in oil, spread like a cake. Leave it to get crispy and browned on the bottom, pressing down once or twice with a spatula. Turn the heat to low, add the egg mixture - with or without the greens - and carry on.</span><br />
