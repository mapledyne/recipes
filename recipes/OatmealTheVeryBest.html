                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon butter, unsalted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (100 g) rolled oats</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup (60 ml) milk</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt, kosher, Diamond Crystal brand (exact)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">pinch of cinnamon, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 cup plus tablespoon water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">(optional)for serving cream, heavy</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">for serving sugar, brown</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup raisins [8142]</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Toast the oats: Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the oats and toast over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until they begin to smell fragrant and nutty, 5 to 7 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">To cook the oats: In a large heavy-bottomed pot, bring the milk, salt, cinnamon, and water to a slow boil over medium heat. Add the raisins. Add the toasted oats and gently stir once or twice to incorporate them into the liquid. Cover the pot and turn off the heat. Allow the oats to sit on the burner for 7 minutes. Don't peek. Don't stir. After 7 minutes, uncover and check the oats. If they're a little wetter than you'd like, allow them to sit in the pot, covered, for another few minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">To serve: A simple, classic way to finish this oatmeal is with a splash of cream and a little brown sugar on top.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Store any cooled leftovers in an airtight container, refrigerated, for up to 5 days. To reheat, you'll likely need to add a bit more liquid as the oatmeal has a tendency to dry out over time.</span><br />
