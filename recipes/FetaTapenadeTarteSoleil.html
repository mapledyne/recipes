                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	Inspired by a whole bunch of YouTube videos; the feta dip is from Ina Garten.

I texted a picture of this to a friend yesterday and she said her husband “thought it was chocolate was getting in the car to come over” which seems like a good time to note the obvious: you could fill your puffed pastry sheets with anything you desire, so long as it’s spreadable and not too runny. On the savory end, I made a pesto-tapenade-ish blend of sundried tomatoes (because the 80s are back), kalamata olives, oregano and garlic and a dip of whipped feta that you could not possibly go wrong with. For a more subtle flavor, basil pesto or another garlic-herb paste, plus or minus some sharp cheese, this walnut pesto or pretty much anything else you can dream up would likely work well here too. Should you want to make a sweet version, perhaps jam, Nutella, melted chocolate, almond or another nut paste, and a sprinkling of cinnamon-sugar or chopped nuts (with or without a puddle of dark chocolate ganache to dip it in) might be fun places to start.

My puffed pastry packages were 1 pound each; my usual favorite brand (DuFour) comes in 14-ounce packages; if yours, too, are smaller, you’ll probably only get a 10 to 11-inch round out of it and might have a tablespoon or two of filling leftover. Btw, I added 1 tablespoon parsley leaves to my filling for color, but as is barely noticeable and added little flavor, you can absolutely skip it.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup sundried tomatoes, in oil, drained</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup olives, kalamata, pitted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon dried oregano or 2 teaspoons oregano leaves, fresh (thyme and/or rosemary would work too), chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 garlic cloves, large, peeled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon olive oil or reserved oil from tomatoes, plus more to loosen if needed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt and freshly ground black pepper or red pepper flakes to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 packages puffed pastry, (leave in fridge overnight to thaw)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg yolks, egg yolk beaten with 1 teaspoon water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon sesame seeds to sprinkle (optional)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 ounces cheese, feta, crumbled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 ounces cream cheese, cold is fine</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons lemon juice</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon coarse or kosher salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Freshly ground black pepper</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Make the filling: Blend ingredients in a food processor until finely chopped and spreadable. Mixture will be thick. You can thin it with more olive oil if needed, but no need to make this thin like a sauce. Adjust seasonings to taste. Set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat oven to 350 degrees.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Assemble the tart: Roll first package puffed pastry flat on a large piece of parchment paper or reusable baking mat into a 12-inch circle; use a 12-inch round plate or bowl to mark the size for a clean cut. Repeat with second dough, setting one aside in the fridge until needed.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place first round on a parchment- or nonstick mat-lined baking sheet. Spread with filling to all but 1-inch from edge. Dab edges with water and place second round on top. Set a small glass upside down in the middle. Being careful not to cut through parchment paper or baking mat, cut away from glass (i.e. not through center) in quarters, or at the 3-, 6-, 9- and 12 o’clock marks. Cut through each quarter again, making 8 strips, and again, making 16 strips, and one last time so that you have 32 “rays” of pastry emanating from the center. If at any point in the cutting the pastry feels annoyingly soft and hard to cut, just pop the tray in the freezer for a few minutes to firm it back up.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove glass. Place finger near center of each ray (where it is most likely to break off prematurely) and gently twist each strand a few times. Beat egg yolk with 1 teaspoon water; brush it over pastry and sprinkle with seeds, if desired.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until golden brown all over.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, make whipped feta dip: Blend all filling ingredients in a blender or food processor until smooth. Adjust seasonings to taste. Place in bowl for dipping.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove tart from oven, let cool on baking sheet for 10 minutes then transfer to a serving platter. Tear off rays of sun, dip in whipped feta; repeat as needed.</span><br />
