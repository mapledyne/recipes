	When it's cold out, I crave potatoes and warming comfort food—and this one’s a ripper. It's perfect served alongside a warm winter roast. Enjoy it with a nice glass of Chardonnay or Pinot Noir. It warms the soul. (less) —Cle-ann

Food52 Review: WHO: Cle-ann is a Greek recipe developer living in Melbourne, Australia. 
WHAT: Roasted potatoes like we've never seen them before—bright, springtime-y, and green. 
HOW: Cover roasted potatoes with an herbaceous blend of cilantro, peas, anchovy, Dijon mustard, horseradish, olive oil, and lemon. (Yes, that's it.) 
WHY WE LOVE IT: After a long winter of root vegetable-centric dinners, we vowed to never touch a potato until next winter—but then we tasted this dish. The green sauce makes the potatoes bright enough to accompany any warm weather meal. Make the pesto ahead of time and freeze it for weeknight meals or barbecues (see you later, potato salad).
