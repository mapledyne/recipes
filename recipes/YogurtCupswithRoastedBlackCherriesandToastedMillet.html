                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound (450 g) cherries, black, fresh or frozen, pitted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon lemon juice, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons honey, liquid</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">generous pinch of kosher salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 cups (135 g) millet</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cups yogurt, plain, full fat organic preferred</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons honey, liquid</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">To prep the cherries: In a large bowl, combine the cherries, lemon juice, 3 tablespoons of honey and salt and mix well. Turn out onto a glass pie plate or baking dish so the berries nestle together and cook in their juices.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bake until the cherries have softened and the juices are beginning to thicken, about 15 minutes. Stire every 5 minutes or so to prevent sticking. Serm warm or at room temperature, or let cool and refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3 days.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">To toast the millet: Pour the millet into a large, dry skillet over mediuem heat.  Toast until fragrant, 4 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally so that it doesn't burn or stick to the pan. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">To assemble the cups: Spoon 1/2 cup of the yogurt into the bottom of each cup. Sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon of the toasted millet and top with a large spoonful of roasted cherries (include a little juice!). Top each with 1/4 cup of the yogurt and another generous spoonful of cherries. Finish each with about 2 tablespoons of the toasted millet and a generous teaspoonful of honey if you'd like. These are best enjoyed shortly after they are made.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">If making ahead - wait until serving to combine all of the ingredients.</span><br />
