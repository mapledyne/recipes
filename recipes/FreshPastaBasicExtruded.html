                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 large eggs</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1-2 tablespoons olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon salt</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">I make the dough in the food processor and start by pulsing the flour with any herbs or salt. Next I add five eggs to the flour, one egg at a time, with a very thorough pulsing after the addition of each egg. This flour and egg combination can usually be squeezed into a ball that will hold its shape after I have pulsed in the fifth egg. Some recipes stop here. I have found that the addition of approximately two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil at this point will make the finished dough much easier to handle, prevent sticking, and help the pasta pieces hold their shape.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Form walnut sized pieces and extrude past into desired shape. Separate and dry as desired.</span><br />
