                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	My husband is a big fan of chipotle – both the spicy, smoky peppers themselves and the restaurant chain. He declared this dish to be better than Chipotle’s fast-casual burrito bowls, so I’m calling it a win!

This is certainly more budget-friendly than ordering take-out for four people. It also cooks in about the same time that it would take us to drive over and pick up dinner!


Read more: The chicken and rice both pack a spicy wallop with this recipe. Boneless chicken thighs are cooked in a homemade chipotle sauce (it’s a blender sauce that comes together in a flash), and the rice is tossed with diced jalapeño peppers, cilantro, and green onions just before serving.

You can definitely cut down on the spice if you’re not a chili head like me. Just use a heaping spoonful of smoked paprika in place of the chipotle peppers, and omit the jalapeno.

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cloves garlic</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 onion, medium yellow</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 chipotles in adobo, canned</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup lime juice, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon honey</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons cumin, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons paprika</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 to 2 pounds chicken thighs, boneless skinless, boneless</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup rice, long-grain white</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup cilantro, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 green onions, sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon lime juice, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 ounces cotija cheese, crumbled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 thin slices jalapeño pepper</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 lime, cut into 4 wedges</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Make the sauce: In a blender, combine the garlic, onion, chipotle peppers, water, lime juice, honey, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper. Blend for about a minute, until it becomes a smooth sauce. If necessary, scrape down the sides of the blender halfway through blending.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Mix the chicken with the sauce: Put the chicken thighs in the pot of a 6-quart or larger electric pressure cooker, then pour the sauce over the chicken and stir to evenly coat the chicken in the sauce.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Nestle a raised steam rack in with the chicken. Make sure all of its legs are touching the bottom of the pot.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Rinse the rice. Place the rice in a wire mesh strainer and rinse under running water. Let it drain for a minute or so, then combine the rice with a cup of water in a small (1 ½-quart) stainless steel mixing bowl.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place the bowl of rice and water on top of the steam rack in the pot. The bowl should fit snugly inside the pot; make sure that you can still lock the lid of the pressure cooker closed.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Cook the chicken and rice: Secure the lid on the pressure cooker. Make sure the pressure regulator is set to the “Sealing” position.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">If you are using an Instant Pot, select the “Poultry” or “Manual” program, then adjust the time to 15 minutes. If your pressure cooker does not have a “Poultry” program, set it manually to “High Pressure” for 15 minutes. For stovetop pressure cookers, cook for 12 minutes at high pressure.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">It will take about 15 minutes for your pressure cooker to come up to pressure, and then the actual cooking will begin. Total time from the time you seal the pressure cooker to the end of cooking is about 30 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Release the pressure: When the cooking time ends, let the pressure release naturally for at least 10 minutes, then perform a quick pressure release by moving the pressure release knob from “Sealing” to “Venting.”</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Fluff the rice: Wearing a pair of heat-proof mitts, remove the bowl of rice and the steam rack from the pot.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Fluff the rice with a fork and mix in the cilantro, green onions, jalapeño, lime juice, and salt.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">8. Working in the pot, shred the chicken thighs into bite-sized pieces with two forks.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">9. Serve: Divide the rice between individual bowls and spoon the chicken on top, along with a some of its sauce. Top each bowl with the cotija cheese, sliced jalapeño, and a wedge of lime.</span><br />
