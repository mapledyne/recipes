                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	This is a cozy, remarkably easy Bundt cake that’s made in homes across Brazil—technically carrot, but acts more like pound, dressed unstintingly with streaks of gooey chocolate ganache. It also happens to be naturally tinted perfectly for Halloween (though I hope you will eat it year-round, for both dessert and breakfast). Recipe translated and adapted from I Could Kill for Dessert.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups (270 g) carrot slices, 1/2-inch pieces peeled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 cup + 1 tablespoon (200 ml) oil, neutral, like grapeseed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 eggs, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups (360 g) sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 3/4 cups (240 g) flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon salt, fine sea</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 ounces (170 g) chocolate, bittersweet, roughly chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon honey</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">7 tablespoons (100 g) butter, unsalted, in 1/2-inch slices</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Heat the oven to 425°F (220°C) with a rack in the center. Butter a 10-inch (25cm) Bundt pan and dust with flour or fine, dry breadcrumbs, tapping out the excess.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. To make the carrot cake: Pile the carrots, oil, eggs, and sugar in the blender. Blend until completely smooth. Pour the carroty mixture into a large bowl and sift the flour and baking powder over the top. Add the salt and fold in the dry ingredients with a spatula until no traces of flour remain.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 5 minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 400°F (200°C) and continue baking for 30 minutes more, rotating the pan midway through baking, until a toothpick stuck in the middle comes out clean or with just crumbs clinging.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn it out onto a rack set over a rimmed baking sheet to finish cooling.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. To make the glaze, once the cake is fully cooled, set up a double boiler (or a metal bowl set over a saucepan with an inch/2.5cm or so of simmering water). Add the chocolate, butter, and honey to the bowl and stir occasionally with a rubber spatula, until the glaze is well-melted and smooth. (Alternately, do this in 30-second bursts in the microwave, stirring between bursts till smooth.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Spoon the glaze over the cake and leave it to set a bit before slicing and serving.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Store leftovers airtight at room temperature. If you don’t have a domed container and you don’t want to disturb the glaze, poke a few toothpicks in the top of the cake and drape plastic wrap over the top, tucking the edges beneath the cake.</span><br />
