                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	This is the recipe that inspired my Little Spinach Pinwheels, but it's so easy I hesitated to post it earlier. This is my answer to those little mushroom turnovers with cream cheese pastry that my mom was so adept at making. It's another good appetizer to stash in the freezer and pull out when unexpected (or expected) company arrives.

This recipe is perfect for anyone looking for a simple yet elegant appetizer. I followed the recipe as written, except I used a combination of butter and olive oil, since I ran out of butter (I know! The horror!). Make sure you roll the puff pastry tightly -- because there is no creamy or cheesy binder, the mushrooms have a tendency to fall out of the sliced pieces as you transfer them to the pan unless the roll is very tightly wound. However, the finished result is one where the flavor of the deeply browned mushrooms really shines through.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces mushrooms, diced finely</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 tablespoons butter</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/8 teaspoon thyme leaves, dried</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon black pepper</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 sheet puff pastry</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg, beaten with 3 tablespoons of water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">a splash sherry, (optional)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">cheese, parmesan, (optional)</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. In a large sauté pan, melt the butter and add the diced mushrooms, thyme, salt, and pepper. Sauté until the liquid from the mushrooms evaporates and they become a little brown and caramelized. If using, add a splash of sherry and cook 1 minute more. Set aside to cool.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Take the puff pastry sheet and roll it into a uniform rectangle about 10 by 12 inches.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Spread the mushroom filling over the surface of the pastry and then roll it tightly jelly roll-style starting with the long side.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Refrigerate the roll for about 20 minutes before slicing into 1/4-inch rounds. (Or wrap and freeze the roll for later use.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Place the little pinwheels on a parchment-lined baking sheet and dab each with a little of the egg wash and optionally sprinkle them with parmesan cheese.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Bake at 425° F for 12 to 15 minutes and serve warm.</span><br />
