                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	When I came across Broccoli Rabe and Orecchiette with White Bean-Anchovy Sauce on the Cook's Illustrated website, it seemed to fulfill all of my great pasta expectations. But the results were disappointing: The pasta was mostly dry and the "sauce" mythical—a case where the name of the recipe tasted better than the food itself. 

To turn it into what I had imagined it would be—where the orecchiette was not in the way of the sauce but empowered by it—I upped the amount of broth; added cream and ricotta for richness (though you can omit those at your discretion); and mashed the beans to a soft consistency. For brightness and spice, there's lemon juice and red pepper flakes. 

Ready quickly (with minimal mess), incredibly flavorful, satisfying enough to eat alone yet acceptable to serve to company, this pasta meets all of my criteria (and I hope yours, too).

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 anchovy fillets, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 medium cloves garlic, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 to 1 teaspoons red pepper flakes, plus more for garnishing</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Two 15 1/2-ounce cans white beans, drained and rinsed (I used cannellini, but any kind of white bean is fine)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/3 cups vegetable stock</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 splash cream, heavy</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt and pepper</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound pasta, orecchiette, penne, or other short</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 pounds broccoli rabe, washed well, trimmedand cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 lemon</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">ricotta cheese, fresh, for garnishing (optional)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">cheese, Pecorino Romano, for garnishing, grated</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. In a medium skillet over medium-low heat, heat the oil, anchovy, garlic, and red pepper flakes, stirring until anchovy dissolves, 1 to 2 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Add beans, stock, and cream (if using). Simmer to thicken, 4 to 5 minutes, smashing the beans gently with a wooden spoon so that some of the beans remain whole but about half become mushy. Remove from heat, season with salt and pepper to taste, and cover to keep warm.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. When boiling, add 1 tablespoon salt and the pasta. Cook until pasta just begins to soften, about 5 to 6 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Add greens; cook until greens are wilted fully and pasta is al dente, 3 to 4 minutes longer.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Reserve 1/3 cup pasta water, then drain the pasta and greens and return to pot. Add sauce and reserved pasta water and cook over medium-low heat, stirring to meld flavors, about 1 minute.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Taste for salt and pepper. Squeeze half a lemon over the pot and mix to combine. Mix in several dollops of fresh ricotta (if using). Serve immediately, topping with grated cheese and more red pepper flakes at the table.</span><br />
