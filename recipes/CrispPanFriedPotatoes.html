                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	This technique produces better results than conventional Home Fries, but you need two things: waxy potatoes, because starchy ones will fall apart before they get crisp; and patience.
Other vegetables you can use: beets, rutabagas, parsnips, or carrots, though they won’t get quite as crisp.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">About 2 pounds waxy potatoes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup peanut, extra virgin olive, or neutral oil, like grapeseed or corn, or more as needed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">black pepper, freshly ground</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Cut potatoes into 1-inch chunks. Put the oil in a large skillet, preferably nonstick or cast-iron, over medium heat. When hot, add the potatoes and cook, undisturbed, until they begin to brown around the edges and release from the pan, about 10 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2.Continue cooking, turning to brown all the sides without stirring too often. (This is the part that takes the most patience.) Add more oil if needed to prevent the potatoes from sticking. And if they are browning too fast, turn the heat down just a tad. They’ll take up to 20 minutes longer to cook.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3.When the potatoes are tender and golden, turn the heat up a bit to crisp them up. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss to coat. Taste, adjust the seasoning, and serve hot or at room temperature.</span><br />
