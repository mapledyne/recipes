                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 bunch asparagus spears, trimmed and chopped into 1 1/2-inch pieces</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup onion, diced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 shallot, diced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 clove garlic, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup rice, arborio</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup white wine</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons lemon juice</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon lemon zest</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 cups vegetable stock</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Sea salt and black pepper, to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup yeast, nutritional</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon thyme leaves, fresh</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Bring a medium saucepan of water to boil. Add the asparagus spears and blanch for about two minutes, or until they're tender but still have some crunch. Remove them from the pan and run under cold water to stop them from cooking further. Set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Heat olive oil in a large saucepan. Add the shallots and onions and cook for four minutes, or until the onions are getting soft. Add the garlic and cook for another three minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Add the rice and heat it in the saucepan, stirring constantly, for about two minutes. Lower the heat to medium-low. Add the white wine, lemon juice, and lemon zest, and cook, stirring gently and vigilantly, till the white wine has been absorbed.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Add a cup of stock to the pan and cook, stirring as needed, till the stock has been absorbed. Continue adding stock in 1/2- to 3/4-cup amounts, stirring each time until the stock is absorbed. You may not need all five cups of broth to make the rice creamy and soft, but you can expect to use most of it. When the rice is tender but still has some chew, stir in the nutritional yeast and thyme, along with salt and pepper to taste.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Stir the blanched asparagus into the rice and heat through. Serve.</span><br />
