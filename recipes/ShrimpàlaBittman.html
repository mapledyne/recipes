                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	A few months ago I wrote about how I like to poach shrimp (and other fish and shellfish) in olive oil. And I still do! But I also like to cook shrimp using a method I learned from Mark Bittman. He slathers shrimp in a loose green sauce and roasts them at 500 degrees (I do 450). The shrimp emerge, unscathed by the heat -- cooked through quickly enough that they remain delicate and plump, with a juicy snap. Recently, I pared down the recipe even more, giving the shrimp a slick of oil, and lemon and lime zest, showering them with the citrus juices at the table.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 pounds shrimp, medium or large, shelled and cleaned</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 lemons, small, zest and juice of 2 small grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 lime, small, zest and juice of 1 grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Heat the oven to 450 degrees. If you're thinking ahead, earlier in the day, combine the zests with the olive oil -- if you're like me and doing this last minute, toss the shrimp with the zests and olive oil. Season with salt. Spread the shrimp in a single layer on a baking sheet.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Squeeze a little lemon juice on top of the shrimp and place in the oven. Roast until the shrimp is just cooked through and still bouncy to the touch, 8 to 10 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Remove the shrimp from the oven, douse with lemon and lime juice and pour into a serving bowl. Eating with your fingers is allowed in my house.</span><br />
