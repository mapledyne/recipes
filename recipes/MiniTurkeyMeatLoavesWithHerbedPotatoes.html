                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tbsp olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 sweet red pepper, finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cloves garlic, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tbsp dried Italian herb seasoning</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups baby spinach, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">450 g lean ground turkey</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup quick-cooking (not instant) rolled oats</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup bottled strained tomatoes, (passata)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tbsp cider vinegar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tsp liquid honey</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 large red-skinned potatoes, scrubbed and cut in 1/2-inch (1 cm) chunks</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 tsp salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 tsp pepper</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In small skillet, heat 1 tsp of the oil over medium heat; cook red pepper, garlic, half of the Italian seasoning, and a pinch each of the salt and pepper, stirring often, until red pepper is softened, about 4 minutes. Stir in spinach; cook until wilted and no liquid remains, about 2 minutes. Transfer to bowl; let cool slightly.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Mix turkey and oats into pepper mixture; roll into eight balls; place one each in wells of nonstick muffin pan.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Stir together strained tomatoes, vinegar and honey; spoon over meat loaves. Bake in 400 F (200 C) oven until instant-read thermometer inserted into several reads 165 F (74 C), about 12 minutes. Broil until sauce on top thickens, about 2 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, in nonstick skillet, heat remaining oil over medium-high heat; cook potatoes, and remaining Italian seasoning, salt and pepper, stirring, until potatoes are lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add 1/2 cup water; reduce heat, cover and simmer until no liquid remains and potatoes are almost tender, about 5 minutes. Uncover and cook, stirring, until potatoes are tender, about 5 minutes. Serve with meat loaves.</span><br />
