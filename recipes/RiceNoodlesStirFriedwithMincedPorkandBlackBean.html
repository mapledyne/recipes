                <span itemprop="description">
	Really not a lot to say about stir-fries that hasn’t been said before. Using a few pantry staples and whatever vegetables you have on hand, you can whip up something delicious in a matter of minutes. They come in handy especially when, say, you’ve been homebound for a week and are running out of options, and you have scraps of leftover vegetables moping around in the refrigerator begging to be productive in some way. 

A new regular in my kitchen that I’ve been using in just about everything that I feel would carry its intense flavor and saltiness—fermented black bean. A little bit goes a long way, and the spicy pungency it provides is definitely a game changer in any stir-fry. The next time you make fried rice, add a teaspoon of it to your eggs before you whisk them up and scramble. I tried this neat trick once, and haven’t had it any other way since. I understand (I do, really) that not every recipe is as blank a canvas as a grilled chicken, but this stir-fry sure is. Add/omit ingredients as you wish and taste taste taste as you go along!

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">200 grams noodles, rice</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">300 grams pork, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup baby corn, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 head of broccoli, chopped into florets</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1-inch pieces ginger, finely sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 cloves garlic, finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 onion, small, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 stalks onions, spring, chopped (set the tops aside to use as garnish)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 teaspoons black bean paste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon vinegar, rice</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon chile flakes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 eggs, lightly beaten</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 red chiles, dried, halved and de-seeded</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon sesame oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons sesame seeds, lightly toasted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons peanuts, coarsely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">black pepper, freshly ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Cook the rice noodles in a pot of boiling water. Immerse the baby corn into the same pot as the noodles 3 minutes before the noodles are done. Blanch the broccoli a minute before both are done, and drain out all together. You want the noodles and vegetables to be al dente and still have a bite to it.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Pour the olive oil into a wok/pot over medium heat and toss in the dried red chiles, onions, spring onions (the bottom part), ginger, and garlic. Sauté for a few minutes until translucent and lightly browned.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Add the pork into the wok and, using a spatula, break up any clumps that are stuck together. Brown the meat thoroughly for a few minutes. Add in the black bean paste, soya sauce, rice vinegar, pepper, and chile flakes. (Note: Start by using 2 teaspoons each of soya sauce and rice vinegar, and taste before adding more). Cook for a few minutes until the rawness of the sauces are cooked off. Taste and adjust seasoning; set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. In a skillet, lightly toast the sesame seeds and peanuts; set aside to sprinkle on top later. In the same skillet, add a few teaspoons of olive oil and lightly scramble the eggs, keeping it just a teeny bit runny.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Toss in the noodles and vegetables into the minced pork mixture; add the scrambled eggs and mix through to combine evenly. Add a little water if necessary to loosen the consistency.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Tip into your serving dish and garnish with the spring onion tops, peanuts, sesame oil, and seeds.</span><br />
