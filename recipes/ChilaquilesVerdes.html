                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 pounds tomatillos in the husk</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 large onion, red, cut in 1/2-inch slices</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 jalapeños</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 cloves garlic, unpeeled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 handful of cilantro leaves, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 lime</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 heaping spoonful sour cream, full fat</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 quart chicken stock</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 chicken breasts, boneless and skin removed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 tortillas, corn</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup queso fresco, in large crumblesor shredded monterrey jack</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup cotija cheese, crumbled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">cilantro leaves, fresh, for garnish</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt and olive oil, as needed</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Lay tomatillos, onions, jalapeños, and garlic on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Place the baking sheet under the broiler, until the veggies are wilted and blistered, about 10 minutes (time will vary based on the heat of your broiler). Remove the veggies and let them cool until you are able to handle them.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Remove the husks from the tomatillos, squeeze the garlic from the cloves, and remove the stem from the jalapeños. Throw the roasted veggies into a blender, along with any juices that accumulated on the baking tray. Add the cilantro leaves, the juice of the lime, and the crema. Purée until the mixture is very smooth. Taste and make any needed adjustments (more salt, acid, etc).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. While the veggies are still in the oven, bring the chicken broth to a gentle simmer in a dutch oven. Add the chicken breasts and allow them to simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Move the chicken to a cutting board and use two forks to shred it. Return the chicken and any juices to the pot.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Add the tomatillo purée to the chicken broth, taste for seasoning (note the sauce should be tangy, almost sour, so add another squeeze of lime if necessary), and bring to a simmer. Cover and let the mixture simmer for about 20 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Cut the tortillas into quarters. If your tortillas are fresh, dry them out in the oven or toaster oven. If they're stale and dried out, add them right to the pot. Stir the mixture and let simmer for another 10 minutes. The tortillas will cause the sauce to thicken.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Uncover and stir in the queso fresco or sprinkle with the monterrey jack. Cover the pot again, allowing the cheese to melt. Uncover, sprinkle with cotija and cilantro, and serve.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">8. Note: The chilaquiles are just as good -- maybe better -- the next day. A fried egg on top wouldn't hurt either!</span><br />
