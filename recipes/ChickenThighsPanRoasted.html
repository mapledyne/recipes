                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	Sophisticated enough for a Sunday supper yet quick enough for Wednesday's dinner, this master recipe is all in the technique. Cook the thighs skin side down in a cast-iron skillet to render out the fat and make the skin as crisp and, dare we say, delicious as bacon.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 chicken thighs</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon oil, vegetable</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">pepper, black, freshly ground</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Preheat oven to 475Â°F. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a 12" cast-iron or heavy nonstick skillet over high heat until hot but not smoking. Nestle chicken in skillet, skin side down, and cook 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-high; continue cooking skin side down, occasionally rearranging chicken thighs and rotating pan to evenly distribute heat, until fat renders and skin is golden brown, about 12 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Transfer skillet to oven and cook 13 more minutes. Flip chicken; continue cooking until skin crisps and meat is cooked through, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer to a plate; let rest 5 minutes before serving.</span><br />
