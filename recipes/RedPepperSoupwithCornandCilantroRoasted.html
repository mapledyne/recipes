                <span itemprop="description">
	If you took all of the ingredients in this soup, threw them into a pot and cooked them together, you'd end up with a pretty delicious result. But Oui, Chef takes the soup to a new flavor planet by enhancing each component. He roasts the tomatoes, peppers, shallots and garlic until they're smoky and charred. He toasts the corn in a pan with thyme and wraps it with butter. And he brightens a cilantro oil with splashes of sherry vinegar. By the time you're done and have all the parts assembled beautifully in a bowl, you have a dinner party star and a soup that you'll want to savor the next day for lunch.

<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 shallots, large, peeled and halved</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 1/2 cups chicken stock, low-sodium, plus more if needed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon pimenton (smoked paprika)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 small bunch cilantro, fresh, well washed and spun dry</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 splash vinegar, sherry</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 small corn on the cob, cut from the cob</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons thyme leaves, fresh, finely minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 shallot, finely minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon butter</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup feta cheese, crumbled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">olive oil, extra-virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and black pepper to taste</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Toss the pepper halves, tomato quarters, halved shallots and garlic cloves in a large bowl, drizzle with olive oil, season with salt and pepper and toss with your hands to coat. Place them all in a single layer, skin side up in a large roasting pan.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Place the pan in the oven and roast for 45 to 60 minutes, until everything has started to take on a nice charred appearance. Check the shallots and garlic at this point, if they are nice and soft, remove from the pan and reserve, if not, you can keep them in the pan for the final 15 minutes of cooking.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. At the one hour mark, remove the pan, peel the charred skin from the tomatoes and peppers, and squeeze the garlic cloves from their skins. Place the skinned tomatoes, peppers, garlic and shallots in a medium pot with the pimenton and chicken stock, bring to a boil, then lower the heat to medium and cook, uncovered, for about 15 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Working in batches, puree the soup in a blender and place in a clean pan, check for seasoning and keep warm.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil, toss in the cilantro and blanch for about 30 seconds. Pull from the pot with a slotted spoon and shock in ice water. When cooled, pour through a strainer to catch the cilantro, and pressing with the palm of your hand, wring as much of the water free as you can. Finely chop the herb, then toss into a bowl with enough EVOO to maker a spoonable cilantro oil, add a splash of sherry vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. Reserve.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Preheat a skillet over a medium flame, and when hot add a splash of olive oil and the minced shallot. Cook until the shallot starts to take on some color, then add the corn kernels, some salt and pepper, and the fresh thyme. Cook for 2 minutes, toss in the butter, and when it melts, remove from the heat and transfer to a bowl.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">8. To serve, place a small pile of the corn in the center of a warmed soup bowl, pour the soup around, drizzle with some cilantro oil, and finally, sprinkle with a little crumbled feta.</span><br />
