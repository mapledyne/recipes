                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	Shakespeare proclaimed music the food of love, but in our family, it’s cookies. From the time my daughter could climb up on a stool and stir chocolate chips into batter, we baked. We created baking experiments for her science projects, and baked cookies and cakes for dinner parties and school functions. My stepsons married women who are both accomplished bakers. Blended families can be...complicated... but baking is the language of our family connection--- chocolate chip cookies, apple pie, brownies, meringues--… a connection that often feels like a miracle. 

I am the oldest of four children, and we—my two sisters, my brother and I—are as close as people who live in four separate US states can be. We were all together for the Christmas holidays, and my sister Linda and I decided to (what else?) bake cookies. 

Linda is a first grade teacher. For Christmas every year, her students give her boxes of candy, bags of pretzels, tins of popcorn. One of her good friends made delicious homemade granola, which we thought would make a great cookie. We decided to make our version of “compost cookies" by adapting a recipe for crispy oatmeal cookies and using some of her leftover snacks and candies. These cookies are fun, flexible, not fancy but really delicious—qualities I try to bring to all my cooking. My brother-in-law David (Linda’s husband) couldn'’t get enough of them, and my husband proclaimed them “best cookies ever.” 

This weekend, at my daughter-in-law’s request, I’ll be making them for my grandson’s first birthday party. In our family, cookies make miracles. - drbabs

Food52 Review: There is a lot to love about this recipe. First of all, it is not bossy. DrBabs gives us the ratios, and then she tells us to pick a salty snack, some candies, some cereal, some sort of nut, and cinnamon or other spices if we are so inclined. I like that. I like that these are pantry cookies because you are sure to have enough this and that to be able to make cookies without a trip to the store. My version had the following; crushed pretzel dipping sticks, a handful of leftover Reeses Pieces, some Ghiardelli semi sweet chips, two granola sample boxes from our last race expo (we don’t really eat granola but they were free!), cinnamon and walnuts. Out of the oven they are chewy with a great sweet and salt combination. After they cool they become the perfect crispy friend to an ice cold glass of milk.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon baking powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon baking soda</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon salt, kosher</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 3/4 sticks (7 ounces) butter, unsalted, room temperature</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup sugar, granulated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup sugar, brown, packed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon vanilla extract</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup granola or oatmeal</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup pretzels, salted, crushed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup chocolate chips, chopped chocolate candies, or a small bar of good dark chocolate, chopped into chunks</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup pecans, chopped or other nuts, optional</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">a little cinnamon, allspice, cardamom or whatever you fancy, optional</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in medium bowl.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. In another bowl, beat butter and sugars at medium-low speed until just combined, about 20 seconds. Increase speed to medium and continue to beat until light and fluffy, about 1 minute longer. Scrape down bowl with rubber spatula. Add egg and vanilla and beat on medium-low until fully incorporated, about 30 seconds. Scrape down bowl again.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. (For this step you can use a wooden spoon or your mixer on slow speed.) Add flour mixture and mix until just incorporated and smooth. Gradually add granola, pretzels, chocolate and nuts, and mix until well incorporated, ensuring that no flour pockets remain and ingredients are evenly distributed. Restrain yourself from eating the raw cookie dough.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Scoop dough into balls, each about 1 1/2 tablespoons, then roll between palms into balls. Place cookies on prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 1/2 inches apart, 8-12 per sheet. Freeze at least 20 minutes, or refrigerate at least one hour before baking. (They will still spread a lot.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper or aluminum foil.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Bake one sheet at a time until cookies are deep golden brown, 13 to 16 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through. Let cool completely before gently moving cookies to wire rack. They will be fragile, especially on the edges.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. If cookies be the food of love, bake on!</span><br />
