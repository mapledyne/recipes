	A note about the tortillas. Sturdy yellow corn tortillas hold up better in these enchiladas than more delicate white corn tortillas. The corn tortillas must be softened before they are rolled and baked in the casserole. Frying them gently in a little oil greatly enhances the flavor of the tortillas.¬†Do not use flour tortillas for this recipe.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Peanut or canola oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 corn tortillas</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons olive oil (or peanut or canola)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 onion, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 clove garlic, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">14 oz can tomatoes, crushed (preferably fire roasted)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 cup or 4oz can chiles, green</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon oregano, dried</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 lb (4 cups) cheese, jack, mild cheddar , or a mix, grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">a handful of cilantro, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup sour cream, full fat</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">half a head lettuce, iceberg</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2 In a large frying pan at medium-high heat add a tablespoon of oil. When the oil is shimmering and hot (not quite smoking), add a corn tortilla to the pan. Cook it for 2-3 seconds, use a metal spatula to turn it over, and cook it for 2 to 3 seconds more. Lift up the tortilla with a spatula, add another tortilla underneath. Cook the second tortilla for 2-3 seconds, lift both tortillas, and add another tortilla underneath. Repeat the process with all the tortillas, adding more oil as needed. This way you can brown and soften the tortillas without using a lot of fat. It's important to pre-cook the tortillas because not only does cooking them help soften them for rolling, cooking them in a little fat helps develop the flavor of the tortillas. As the tortillas brown a little, remove them to a plate.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Heat olive oil in a large sauté pan on medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for 5-6 minutes, until translucent. Add the garlic and cook for a minute more. Add the crushed tomatoes. Add the green chiles. Add 1/2 cup of water. Add the oregano. Bring to a simmer and taste. If the sauce tastes too vinegary, add half a teaspoon of sugar to the sauce. Remove from heat.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Put a little olive oil on the bottom of a 3-quart casserole pan. Take a tortilla, cover 2/3 of it lightly with the shredded cheese, then roll up the tortilla and place it in the casserole pan. Continue until all tortillas are filled and rolled.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Add sauce to the top of the tortillas in the the casserole pan. Make sure the rolled up tortillas are covered with the sauce. If not, add a little water to thin the sauce to spread it more evenly over the tortillas. Cover the whole thing with the rest of the grated cheese. Put the casserole in the oven for 10-15 minutes or until the cheese melts.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Serve with sliced iceberg lettuce that has been dressed only with vinegar and salt. Garnish enchiladas with cilantro and sour cream.</span><br />
