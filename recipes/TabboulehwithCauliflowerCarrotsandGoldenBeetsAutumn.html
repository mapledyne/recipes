	This salad is best if you can give it a full 30 minutes to rest before serving. It can also be made up to 3 days ahead and kept refrigerated.

To make this dish gluten-free, substitute quinoa for the bulgur. (Follow package directions to cook the quinoa.)

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup bulgur wheat</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon salt, kosher</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 head cauliflower, medium</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 carrots, medium, peeled and trimmed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 beets, golden, small, peeled and trimmed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup lemon juice, freshly squeezed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon salt, kosher</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups parsley, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 bunch scallions, trimmed and minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon vinegar, sherry</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Ground black pepper or to taste</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Make the bulgur: Bring 3 cups of water to a boil in a small saucepan. When the water boils, stir in the bulgur and salt. Cover the pan and remove from heat. Let the bulgur sit for 20 to 30 minutes or until tender. Strain bulgur with a mesh strainer, shaking to remove as much water as possible.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Prep the vegetables: Break the cauliflower into large florets and carefully slice them 1/16-inch thick on a mandolin. Next, switch to a julienne blade and julienne 1/8-inch thick to julienne carrots and beets. (The vegetables can be shredded on a box grater or in a food processor, instead.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Marinate the vegetables: Combine the vegetables in a large serving bowl and toss with salt and lemon juice. Set aside 20 minutes to marinate, until crisp-tender.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Finish the salad: To the bowl with the vegetables, add the olive oil, cooked bulgur, parsley, scallions, and sherry vinegar. Stir to combine. Taste and add salt, lemon juice, or olive oil as needed.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Let stand 30 minutes before serving: Cover and let mixture marinate at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before serving to give the flavors time to combine. (If marinating longer, set in the fridge.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Salad will keep well covered in the fridge for 3 days.</span><br />
