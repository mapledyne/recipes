                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 to 3 pounds salmon fillets, skin-on</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">oil, canola</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 cup soy sauce</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 garlic cloves, minced</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Combine marinade ingredients in a bowl.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Cut filles 1 1/2 to 2-inches wide. Place marinade ingredients in a large casserole dish (or a plate with sides so the marinade doesn't run). Coat the salmon fillets in the marinade and then place them skinless-side down in the marinade.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Marinate for 20 minutes for a quick marinade (can do this at room temperature while you are preparing the grill) or if you have more time from 1-2 hours chilled in the refrigerator. Before grilling, remove fillets from marinade and discard marinade.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Prepare grill for high direct heat (if you are using a charcoal grill, prepare one side of the grill for high direct heat and the other sideÂ with fewer coals for indirect heating). When the grill is hot (you should be able to hold your hand one inch above the grill grates for only 1 second), spray or brush oil generously on both sides of fish fillets. Place fillets on grill, skinless side down first, so that they can get nice grill marks on the hot grill while the fish is still firm. Close the grill lid. Cook 1-3 minutes on the first side, depending on how thick the fillets are.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Once the fish fillets have been placed on the grill, do not move them until you are going to flip them over, otherwise they may fall apart.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Look for grill marks on the fish and a small layer of opaque (cooked) fish where the fish is closes to the grill. Using tongs, and a metal spatula to help if necessary, carefully turn the fish onto the other side, so that the skin side is now on the grill grates.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">If you are using a charcoal grill, the fillets should be placed on the side of the grill furthest from the coals. If you are using a gas grill, just reduce the flame to medium.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Close the grill lid. Cook for another 2-5 minutes, again depending on the thickness of the fillets. Salmon should be just barely opaque throughout when done.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Better to err on the side of undercooking the salmon, rather than overcooking. You can always put the fish back on the grill, but once a good fillet is overcooked, there's nothing you can do.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove from grill and serve immediately.</span><br />
