                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 pounds chicken parts, boneless skinless, cut into 3 to 4 large chunks (I use a 50/50 mix of breasts and thighs)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 small onion, yellow, chopped small</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 garlic cloves, large, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon cumin, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 teaspoons oregano, dried</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons sea salt, fine grain</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 - 2 jalapenos  or a ground chili powder of your choice, minced, to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes, fire-roasted if you can find them or 2 10-ounce cans tomatoes, crushed  (preferably fire roasted)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 2/3 cups beans, small dried (I use half black beans, half small red beans)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 1/3 cups water (can replace all or part with broth)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">for serving lime wedges</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">for serving tortilla chips, baked, optional</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">for serving cilantro leaves, fresh, optional</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Throw everything in the pot and turn the heat on:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">On the stove: Simmer the ingredients on low until the beans are tender, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Stir occasionally.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a slow-cooker: On HIGH for 4 1/2 to 5 hours or on LOW for 8 to 10.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a pressure-cooker: I am sorry but I haven’t tested it out in mine but my estimate, based on other recipes, would be 22 to 25 minutes, depending on the size of the beans. You can use your pressure cooker’s manual as starting point, as well.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">To finish: The chicken will likely have fallen apart, but you can help it along by reaching into the pot with two forks and shredding it to your desired texture. Taste and adjust seasonings. Serve with fixings of your choice.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">P.S. We like this with baked tortilla chips. I estimate two small corn tortillas per person and cut them into 8 wedges. Brush a large baking sheet lightly with olive oil, arrange tortilla wedges in one layer, lightly dab the tops with more olive oil and sprinkle with fine salt. Bake at 350 for 10 minutes, check for color, and add more baking time as needed until they’re golden and crisp.</span><br />
