                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 bag (16 oz) spinach, baby, organic preferred, in bag</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon olive oil, extra-virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 garlic cloves to taste, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">pepper black, freshly ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 tortillas, corn</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 ounces goat cheese, crumbled 1/2 cup</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Wash the spinach but do not dry. Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large, heavy frying pan. Add the garlic. Cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds, then stir in the spinach. Raise the heat, and stir just until the spinach wilts. Remove from the heat. Press down on the spinach with the back of your spoon, and drain off any water in the pan. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. In a microwave: Place a corn tortilla on a plate. Top with half the spinach, and spread in an even layer. Sprinkle on half the cheese, and top with another tortilla. Press down gently, then microwave for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, until the cheese has melted. Remove from the microwave, cut into quarters or sixths, and serve. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. In a pan: Place a corn tortilla in the pan. Top with half the spinach, and spread in an even layer. Sprinkle on half the cheese. Turn the heat to medium-high, and heat until the cheese begins to melt. Place another tortilla on top of the cheese, and press down lightly. Flip the quesadilla over in the pan, and heat for about 30 seconds or until the cheese has melted. Flip back over, and remove to a plate. Cut into quarters or sixths, and serve. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Note:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Advance preparation: The cooked spinach will keep for a couple of days in the refrigerator. Reheat gently before assembling the quesadillas.</span><br />
