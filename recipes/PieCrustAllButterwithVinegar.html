                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/4 cups flour, unbleached all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon salt, kosher</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 teaspoons sugar, granulated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 pound (1 stick) butter, unsalted, cold, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup water, cold</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons vinegar, cider</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup ice</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Stir the flour, salt, and sugar together in a large bowl.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Add the butter pieces and coat with the flour mixture using a bench scraper or spatula.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. With a pastry blender, cut the butter into the flour mixture, working quickly until mostly pea-size pieces of butter remain (a few larger pieces are okay; be careful not to overblend).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Combine the water, cider vinegar, and ice in a large measuring cup or small bowl.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the ice water mixture over the flour mixture, and mix and cut it in with a bench scraper or spatula until it is fully incorporated.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Add more of the ice water mixture, 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time, using the bench scraper or your hands (or both) to mix until the dough comes together in a ball, with some dry bits remaining.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Squeeze and pinch with your fingertips to bring all the dough together, sprinkling dry bits with more small drops of the ice water mixture, if necessary, to combine.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">8. Shape the dough into a flat disc, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably overnight, to give the crust time to mellow.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">9. If making the double-crust version, divide the dough in half before shaping each portion into flat discs.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">10. Wrapped tightly, the dough can be refrigerated for 3 days or frozen for 1 month.</span><br />
