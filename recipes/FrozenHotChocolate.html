                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 ounces chocolate, semi- or bittersweet, roughly chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon cocoa powder, unsweetened</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons sugar, granulated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons sugar, granulated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups milk, whole, cold</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cups ice</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup cream, heavy or whipping, cold</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Chocolate shavings, for garnish</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Melt chocolate in a small/medium saucepan over very low heat, stirring constantly and not letting it cook a moment beyond its melted point. Remove from heat. Stir in cocoa and 2 tablespoons sugar. Drizzle in 1/2 cup milk very slowly, whisking the whole time. If any chocolate firms up, return the saucepan to a low stove, warming and whisking the mixture until it melts again.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Off the heat, stir in the remaining 1 cup of cold milk, which should make the chocolate base cold. If not, let it chill in the freezer for a few minutes to hasten the cooling along.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Beat heavy cream with remaining 2 teaspoons sugar until soft peaks form. You can do this vigorously by hand or with an electric mixer.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a blender, combine ice and chocolate-milk mixture until as smooth as a frozen cocktail. Pour into a glass — a goblet is traditional at the restaurant, but any glass you have will do — dollop with whipped cream and finish with shaved chocolate. Serve with a straw and a spoon.</span><br />
