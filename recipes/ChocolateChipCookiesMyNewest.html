                <span itemprop="description">
	My Classic Best Chocolate Chip Cookies have been my favorites for close to twenty years. I still love them, but when it comes to chocolate chip cookies, it's hard to be constant. Recipes for chocolate chip cookies are like scarves—you're always happy to have a new one. And so, here's my new cookie. Not radically different from the old one... but different enough you'll want to make both. 

The cookie, with its combination of all-purpose and whole wheat flours and a different mix of white and brown sugars, bakes to a chewier cookie than my classic. I added nutmeg and coriander to the dough, and it's up to you if you'd like to use them or not—or if you'd like to use even more. Or maybe you want to flavor the dough with a little instant espresso (1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon), with or without ground cinnamon (1/4 teaspoon), or even a little (1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon) Chinese five-spice powder. 

You can use the dough soon after it's made, but it improves with more chill time. If you can wait a day to bake the cookies, do.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 3/4 cups (238 grams) flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2/3 cup (91 grams) flour, whole wheat</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 teaspoon baking soda</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, freshly grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon coriander or cardamon, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 sticks (8 ounces; 226 grams) butter, unsalted, at room temperature,  cut into chunks</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (200 grams) sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 cup (150 grams) sugar, brown, firmly packed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/4 teaspoons sea salt, fine grain</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 eggs, large, at room temperature</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons vanilla extract, pure</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">10 ounces (283 grams) chocolate, semisweet or bittersweet, coarsely chopped (or 1 2/3 cups chocolate chips)</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Whisk both flours, the baking soda, nutmeg, and coriander together.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Working with a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large bowl with a hand mixer, beat the butter, both sugars, and the salt together on medium speed until smooth, about 3 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. One by one, add the eggs and beat for 1 minute after each goes in. Beat in the vanilla. Turn the mixer off, add the dry ingredients all at once and pulse to begin the blending, then mix on low speed until the dough comes together and the flour has disappeared. Add the chocolate and incorporate on low speed or mix in by hand with a sturdy flexible spatula. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate it for at least 1 hour.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Position the racks to divide the oven into thirds and preheat it to 375° F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Using a tablespoon, scoop out level portions of dough. Roll each tablespoon of dough between your palms to make a ball and place the balls at least 2 inches apart on the lined baking sheets.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Bake for 9 to 11 minutes, rotating the pans top to bottom and front to back after 6 minutes, or until the cookies have spread, puffed a little, turned a light golden brown, and feel only just set around the edges. Transfer the baking sheets to racks and let the cookies rest on the sheets for at least 5 minutes before letting them onto the racks to cool to just warm or room temperature.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Repeat with the remaining dough, being certain to use cool baking sheets.</span><br />
