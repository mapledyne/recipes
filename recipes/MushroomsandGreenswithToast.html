                <span itemprop="description">
	I resisted, for once, but I think this would be lovely with some crispy eggs on top. But I’d otherwise consider this a one-pan meal. No, a one-pan miracle. For mushrooms, O’Brady suggests chanterelles, shiitake and oyster mushrooms and I admit I got carried away, buying a few fancy ones (a trumpet mushroom too!) along with creminis, but you could make this entirely with small white or brown mushroom and it would still be delicious. For the greens, kale, chard, spinach or nettles are suggested; I use lancinato kale leaves. And for a cheese, it really doesn’t matter what you use, only that you like it and it likes to melt. Chèvre, mozzarella, burrata, taleggio and fontina are all “fair game,” she writes. I went with a soft, melty fontina and it was perfect here. I used the bread I’m most obsessed with, massive whole wheat sourdough loaves that you can buy in quarters at Balthazar’s bakery on Spring Street or in Englewood, NJ or at any outlet of the Le Pain Quotidien chain, but of course any bread you enjoy eating will work well here too.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons butter, unsalted, divided</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 pounds mushrooms, mixed, cleaned, trimmed and torn into bite size pieces (see suggestions above)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 thick slices bread, crusty, (I’d use 4 from a smaller loaf)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cloves garlic (or 1 shallot), minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon vinegar, white wine, or more to taste (I used 2)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 chile, fresh red or red pepper flakes, stemmed, seeded and minced to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 ounces greens, fresh (see suggestions above), chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces cheese, good melting, thickly sliced (suggestions above)</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Melt 2 tablespoons butter and olive oil together in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. One fully hot, add mushrooms to pan and cook, stirring regularly, until they’ve released their water and started to turn golden brown, about 8 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, grill or toast your bread.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">One the mushrooms have a nice color on them, add the garlic or shallots and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Drizzle with vinegar, most of the chile or chile flakes, salt and pepper and stir to combine. Add the greens; pretty much any kind aside from baby spinach will benefit from about 5 to 8 minutes cooking time, just until collapsed. If you’re me, you’ll add 1 more tablespoon vinegar for brightness at this point. Stir in remaining tablespoon butter and adjust seasonings to taste. Rip bread into irregular croutons and push them into the sauteed vegetables. Lay pieces of cheese atop everything. Turn the heat down to medium low, place a lid on the pan and let the cheese melt, which will take 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the pan and the kind of cheese you used.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Sprinkle with remaining chile, “hand out forks, then bring the the pan to the table.”</span><br />
