	Thin and crispy oatmeal lace cookies can seem magical if you have never made them before, but they are actually very easy.

Just melt sugar and butter, and then add the oats and flour to make a thin batter. Don’t be scared of how thin it seems!

The cookies spread and caramelize in the oven, creating a thin and crispy network of sugar that’s just substantial enough to hold the oats together.

Yummy! A version we make in Denmark is melting dark chocolate on one side of an oatmeal cookie and sticking it to another – also delicious! I highly recommend it!

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup (115 g or 1 stick) butter, unsalted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (220 g) sugar, dark brown</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons vanilla extract</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon salt, kosher</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups (170 g) rolled oats, thick cut</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Preheat the oven to 350F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Melt the butter and sugar: Place the butter and brown sugar in medium saucepan. Place over medium heat until the butter melts and the brown sugar dissolves into the liquid butter.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Mix in the flour: Remove the pan from heat and stir in the flour, vanilla, and salt. The batter will be very thin. Set aside for 10 minutes to cool.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Mix in the egg and oats: Once the liquid has cooled (it’s OK if it is still warm, just not piping hot), add the egg and mix with a fork until incorporated. Add the oats and stir until well distributed.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Divide and shape the cookies: Spoon 1 tablespoon of the batter onto the baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches or more of space between each one. Use the back of a spoon to spread each cookie into a thin circle, so the oats are in a single layer. If you don't have enough room on one baking sheet, bake the cookies in batches.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Bake the cookies: Bake in the oven for 8 minutes or until the edges of the cookies start to turn dark golden brown. Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool completely on the parchment paper. The cookies should peel easily from the parchment, but use an offset spatula if any are sticking.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days between sheets of parchment paper.</span><br />
