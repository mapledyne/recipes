                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6  slices bacon</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3  tablespoons vinegar, red wine</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2  tablespoons mayonnaise</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2  teaspoons canned chipotle chiles in adobo sauce, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt and pepper</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3  tablespoons olive oil, plus extra for brushing</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3  pounds potatoes, small red, halved, unpeeled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 large (1.5 lbs) onion, sliced into 1/2-inch-thick rounds</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 scallions (green onions), sliced thin</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Cook bacon in 12-inch skillet over medium heat until crisp, 7 to 9 minutes; transfer to paper towelâ€“lined plate. Set aside 2 tablespoons bacon fat. When cool enough to handle, crumble bacon and set aside. Whisk vinegar, mayonnaise, chipotle, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper together in large bowl. Slowly whisk in 3 tablespoons oil until combined; set aside dressing.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Turn all burners to medium.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Clean and oil cooking grate. Toss potatoes with reserved bacon fat and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Push toothpick horizontally through each onion round to keep rings intact while grilling. Brush onion rounds lightly with extra oil and season with salt and pepper. Place potatoes, cut side down, and onion rounds on grill and cook, covered, until charred on first side, 10 to 14 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Flip potatoes and onion rounds and continue to cook, covered, until well browned all over and potatoes are easily pierced with tip of paring knife, 10 to 16 minutes longer. Transfer potatoes and onion rounds to rimmed baking sheet and let cool slightly.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. When cool enough to handle, halve potatoes; remove toothpicks and coarsely chop onion rounds. Add potatoes, onion, scallions, and bacon to dressing and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve warm or at room temperature.</span><br />
