                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	A few quick and lazy tricks are within this recipe: I rush things along more than ever these days, making a pie dough and plopping the wrapped packed directly in the freezer (if you don’t have half to a full day to chill it in the fridge) for about 20 minutes until firm, but please keep an eye on it, we don’t want it fully frozen. Then, I roll it out, freeze it right on the pie plate and use foil to hold the shape instead of pie weighs. While the crust is parbaking, we’ll make the filling and you can pour it in right as it comes out of the oven, which is all to say that yes, pie dough and filling is work, but this one, with these tricks, can come together in under two hours, most of which you can spend doing work watching Instagram stories.

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Make pie dough:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">– By hand : In the bottom of a large bowl, combine the flour, salt and sugar. Work the butter into the flour with your fingertips or a pastry blender until mixture resembles a coarse meal and the largest bits of butter are the size of tiny peas. (Some people like to do this by freezing the stick of butter and coarsely grating it into the flour, but I haven’t found the results as flaky.) Add 1/4 cup cold water and stir with a spoon or flexible silicone spatula until large clumps form. Use your hands to knead the dough together, right in the bottom of the bowl. If necessary to bring the dough together, you can add another tablespoon of water.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">– With a food processor: In the work bowl of a food processor, combine flour, salt and sugar. Add butter and pulse machine until mixture resembles a coarse meal and the largest bits of butter are the size of tiny peas. Turn mixture out into mixing bowl. Add 1/4 cup cold water and stir with a spoon or flexible silicone spatula until large clumps form. Use your hands to knead the dough together, right in the bottom of the bowl. If necessary to bring the dough together, you can add the last tablespoon of water.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">– Both methods: Wrap dough in a sheet of plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour, or up to 48 hours, or you can quick-firm this in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes. Longer than 2 days, it’s best to freeze it until needed.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat oven: To 400°F (205°C).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Roll out crust: On a floured counter, roll the dough out into a 12 to 13-inch circle-ish shape. Fold dough gently in quarters without creasing and transfer to a 9 1/2-inch standard (not deep-dish) pie plate. Unfold dough and trim overhang to about 1/2-inch. Fold overhang under edge of pie crust and crimp decoratively. Save scraps in fridge, just in case.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Par-bake crust: Freeze for 15 minutes, until solid. Dock all over with a fork. Coat a piece of foil with butter or nonstick spray and press tightly against frozen pie shell, covering the dough and rim and molding it to fit the shape of the edges. Bake for 20 minutes, then carefully, gently remove foil. If any parts have puffed, just press them gently back into place. Patch any tears or cracks with reserved dough scraps. Leave oven on.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, make filling: Melt butter in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Add the sugar and salt and stir to combine (it will be clumpy, not smooth) then let simmer for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring. Whisk in cream and remove from heat. Let mixture cool for 15 minutes, then whisk in eggs, one at a time, and the vanilla.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Assemble and bake: As soon as crust comes out of oven, you can pour in the filling. Bake for 10 minutes at 400°F, and then reduce heat to 300°F (150°C) and bake pie another 25 to 30 minutes. A fully baked pie will only jiggle slightly in center when moved.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Let cool completely — we like this completely cold from the fridge — and serve in wedges with softly whipped cream.</span><br />
