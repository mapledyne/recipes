                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups oats, rolled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups buttermilk</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tbsp sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tsp baking powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tsp baking soda</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 eggs, large, lightly beaten</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, unsalted, melted but not hot</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">vegetable oil or spray, for greasing the pan</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">syrup, maple, for serving</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">The night before:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Combine the oats and buttermilk in a medium bowl. Stir to mix. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">The morning of:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Take the bowl of buttermilk and oats out of the fridge. Set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In another medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add the eggs and melted butter to the oat mixture, and stir well. Add the flour mixture, and stir to blend. The batter will be very thick.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Warm a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium-high heat, and brush (or spray) with vegetable oil. To make sure it’s hot enough, wet your fingers under the tap and sprinkle a few droplets of water onto the pan. If they sizzle, it’s ready. Scoop the batter, about a scant ¼ cup at a time, onto the pan, taking care not to crowd them. When the underside is nicely browned and the top looks set around the edges, flip the pancakes. Cook until the second side has browned.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Re-grease the skillet, and repeat with more batter. If you find that the pancakes are browning too quickly, dial the heat back to medium.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Serve hot, with maple syrup.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Yield: about 12 pancakes, or 3 to 4 servings</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">If you want to add blueberries here, you can use fresh or frozen. (And if you’re using frozen, there’s no need to thaw them. The hot pan will do that for you.) I don’t like to stir the berries into the batter, because then you wind up with weird purple streaks, so I press them into the individual pancakes as they cook. You can use however many berries you want, but be sure to add them after the pancakes have cooked on their first side for a minute or two, so that the batter has time to start to set. When you flip the pancakes, the heat of the pan will make the berries sizzle and soften nicely.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Also, if you find yourself with any leftover pancakes, as I often do, know that they are delicious. This past Saturday, I had three left over, so I put them in a plastic bag on the kitchen counter, and I ate them cold that night, after going out for a drink, a completely undrinkable drink, with a girlfriend. I love gin, and I love Lillet, and I have nothing against Scotch, but apparently I do not care for the union of gin, Lillet, and Scotch. Cold pancakes saved the day.</span><br />
