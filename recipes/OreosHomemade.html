Let’s talk about the sugar for a minute, shall we? This is a sweet cookie. A good, sweet cookie. Yet, if you think of an actual Oreos, the wafers are fairly un-sweet and actually on the slightly salty side, which contrasts with the super-sweetness of the filling bringing harmony, happiness, yada yada. If you want your cookie closer to that original, you can take out a full half-cup of the sugar. If you want to make the cookie by itself (as I did a while back for ice cream sandwiches), go ahead and use the full amount.

<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon baking powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 to 1 1/2 cups (200 to 300 grams) sugar [see recipe note]</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons (1 1/4 sticks or 140 grams) butter, unsalted, room-temperature</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup (1/2 stick or 55 grams) butter, unsalted, room-temperature</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup (50 grams) vegetable shortening</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups (240 grams) confectioners’ sugar, sifted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons (10 ml) vanilla extract</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1.Set two racks in the middle of the oven. Preheat to 375°F.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2.In a food processor, or bowl of an electric mixer, thoroughly mix the flour, cocoa, baking soda and powder, salt, and sugar. While pulsing, or on low speed, add the butter, and then the egg. Continue processing or mixing until dough comes together in a mass.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3.Take rounded teaspoons of batter and place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet approximately two inches apart. With moistened hands, slightly flatten the dough. Bake for 9 minutes, rotating once for even baking. Set baking sheets on a rack to cool.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4.To make the cream, place butter and shortening in a mixing bowl, and at low speed, gradually beat in the sugar and vanilla. Turn the mixer on high and beat for 2 to 3 minutes until filling is light and fluffy.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5.To assemble the cookies, in a pastry bag with a 1/2 inch, round tip, pipe teaspoon-size blobs of cream into the center of one cookie. Place another cookie, equal in size to the first, on top of the cream. Lightly press, to work the filling evenly to the outsides of the cookie. Continue this process until all the cookies have been sandwiched with cream. Dunk generously in a large glass of milk.</span><br />
