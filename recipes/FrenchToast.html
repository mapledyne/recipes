                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup milk, I used whole but he probably used 2%)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 eggs, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 Tbs sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tsp vanilla extract pure</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Mild-tasting vegetable oil, such as canola</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 slices bread, country French loaf, or challah, preferably a bias-cut about 3/4 to 1 inch thick</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">maple syrup, pure, for serving</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Whisk together the first five ingredients in a wide, shallow bowl.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place a large skillet, preferably cast-iron, over low to medium heat, and add enough oil to just cover the bottom of the skillet.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Two or three at a time, add the bread slices to the egg mixture in the bowl, allowing them to rest for a minute or two on each side. They should feel heavy and thoroughly saturated, but they should not be falling apart. When the oil is hot, place the slices in the skillet. They should sizzle a bit, and the oil should bubble lightly around the edges of the bread; take care, however, that the oil is not too hot, lest the egg mixture burn. Cook until the underside of each slice is golden brown, about 2 minutes. Turn the bread, and cook until the second side is golden, another 2 minutes or so. Remove the bread from the skillet to a plate lined with a paper towel, allow to rest for 30 seconds or so, and serve immediatelyâ€”with maple syrup, of course.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Yield: 6 slices, serving 2 or 3.</span><br />
