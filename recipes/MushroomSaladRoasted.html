	Author Notes: This recipe is adapted from Tyler Florence's website. I love using a wide variety of mushrooms and to serve them as a side dish with grilled meats and fish, as a savory sandwich topping, or simply by themselves as a late-night snack with wine and cheese. (less) - cucina di mammina


Food52 Review: I used a wild mushroom assortment to make this. I was making halibut and wanted a tasty side. This salad worked very well along side the fish and a light green salad. I also used it on an open-faced grilled cheese made on Struan bread topped with Gruyère cheese.
