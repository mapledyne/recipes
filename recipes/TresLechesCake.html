                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	I reviewed 100 recipes online, I hunted through all of my cookbooks, and then I turned to one of my secret favorite sources for authentic cooking lessons — YouTube videos with fairly low production values, preferably not in English. After watching a few Mexican grandmothers make theirs from what seemed to be memory, a few themes emerged: all of them use a classic sponge cake (soft and light, with almost all of its texture and volume from whipped eggs), and almost none use the kind with butter in it; buttery cakes won’t absorb all that liquid as well. While 90 percent of them whip their egg whites and yolks separately and then fold them together, after seeing one or two make a go of it as almost a one-bowl cake, I did just this and will never go back. Finally, just about everyone seems to agree that because the cake is exceptionally sweet, as it should be, the whipped topping doesn’t need to be. From here, I made the tres leches cake that will be my forever go-to, which means it’s time for the next dinner party, right?

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 3/4 cups (230 grams) flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup (30 grams) cornstarch</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon salt, kosher</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons baking powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 eggs, large, separated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped from pods or 2 teaspoons vanilla extract</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/4 cups (250 grams) sugar, granulated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup (60 ml) milk, whole</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 (12-ounce or 340 grams) can milk, evaporated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 (14-ounce or 400 grams) can milk, sweetened condensed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups (355 ml) cream, heavy or light (half-and-half)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) rum, (optional)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups (475 ml) cream, heavy (for whipped topping)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons (15 grams) sugar, powdered or granulated (for whipped topping)</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour a 9×13 baking pan, or coat it with a nonstick cooking spray.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a small bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch (together, these make “cake flour” without you having to buy it), salt and baking powder. If using a fresh vanilla bean, rub seeds into 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar to disperse them and help release the most flavor. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat egg whites on medium speed until soft peaks form. With the machine still running, gradually add the sugar (vanilla bean-infused or plain) and beat on medium-high until stiff peaks form. If you haven’t used a vanilla bean, now add your vanilla extract and beat to combine.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add yolks one at at time, beating thoroughly after each addition. Add milk and beat just to combine. Add flour mixture, one-third at at time, folding in each addition gently by hand.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Pour batter in prepared pan and smooth top. Bake for 18 to 24 minutes, or until a tester inserted into cake comes out clean. Let completely cool in pan on a rack.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a large bowl, preferably one with a pouring spout, whisk together evaporated milk, condensed milk and 1 1/2 cups heavy or light cream. Add rum, if using. Use a wooden skewer to poke holes all over cake. Pour all but 1/2 cup milk mixture over cake and transfer to fridge, giving the cake several hours but ideally overnight to soak it up. (Save last bit of milk mixture for serving.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Before serving, beat 2 cups heavy cream with 2 tablespoons powdered or granulated sugar until soft peaks form. Spread over top of cake.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Serve cake in squares, first pouring a little puddle of reserved three-milk mixture at the bottom of plate.</span><br />
