                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 sweet potato, large, peeled and cut into 1/2 in cubes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 apple, cored, peeled and diced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 red onion, diced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoons butter, vegan</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt and pepper to taste</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Heat iron skillet (or nonstick skillet) over medium heat with enough olive oil to coat the bottom. Let warm for a few minutes. You don't want to throw your sweet potatoes into a cold skillet with cold oil - it should sizzle a little bit.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Add sweet potatoes and stir around a little to coat in the oil. Let cook untouched for about 5 minutes. Then give them a toss, bottoms should be a little browned, and cook another 5 minutes. Add additional oil in needed to keep them from sticking.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Add onion and apple, cook 4-5 minutes until everything is tender and the sweet potatoes are browned.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Stir in butter if using, give a toss to melt it and coat everything. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve.</span><br />
