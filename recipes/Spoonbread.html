                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	I can still remember tasting my first spoonbread. It was several years ago in my backyard in San Francisco, at a potluck that our upstairs neighbors were throwing. Iâ€™ll admit that, as someone with strong feelings about cornbread, I was skeptical. It was kind of squishy-looking, without the browned, shattery crust of a properly baked southern cornbread. I spooned some on my plate to be polite, and knowing me, covered it with pie (this was also the potluck where I discovered the magical combination of raspberries and almond). Once I took a bite, though, I immediately hunted down the person who brought it. For some reason, they never shared the recipe with me, but I thought about it for years. One day I decided to research spoonbread, to find out what this magical bread was and where it came from. I was appalled to learn that it was a Southern tradition that had somehow never made it into my kitchen. Clearly I had some catching up to do.

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups corn kernels, raw</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 eggs, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 ounces butter, unsalted, melted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon salt, kosher</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon baking powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup sour cream</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup masa harina</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup Feta, green and yellow package, vacuum sealed, preferred</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 ounces bacon, diced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 ounces snap peas, sliced 1/4-inch thick</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 ounce scallions, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons oil, high heat</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 ounces tomatoes, cherry or grape</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons hot sauce, Crystal brand (exact), or more to taste (recipe included)</span><br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Make the Spoonbread:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Generously butter a 1 1/2 quart baking dish.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Combine the corn, eggs, melted butter, salt, and baking powder in a blender. Blend until almost smooth.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place the sour cream and masa harina in a large bowl. Pour about 1/3 of the pureed corn mixture into the bowl. Stir well until the mixture is smooth. Pour in the rest of the pureed corn mixture and stir to combine well. Add the feta and stir to evenly distribute. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish and place in the oven. Bake until the spoonbread is puffed and golden brown in spots on top, about 45 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Make the topping:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place the bacon in a large skillet and place the pan over low heat. Slowly cook the bacon, stirring occasionally, until the fat has rendered and it gets crisp and brown. Add the snap peas and green onions, raise the heat to medium-low, and cook just until they begin to wilt. Remove from the heat and set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the same skillet over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add the oil. When the oil is almost smoking, add the tomatoes. Cook until the tomatoes are lightly charred and almost ready to burst, about 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat and add to the bacon mixture.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Stir the hot sauce into the bacon-vegetable mixture. Taste, and add more hot sauce, salt, or pepper, if needed. Spoon over the spoonbread and serve immediately.</span><br />
