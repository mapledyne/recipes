                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 3/4 cups flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon baking powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup butter, , very cold, cubed,plus melted butter for brushing the biscuits</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup cheese, cheddar (Tillamook, sharp), shredded</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup milk</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Preheat your oven to 425Â° F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, garlic powder, and baking powder.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Cut in the cold butter using a fork or pastry cutter. The mixture should have pea-sized lumps.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Stir in the cheddar cheese with a fork and pour in the milk. Stir until the dough is a shaggy, wet mess. Once it mostly comes together, use your hands to fold in the dry bits that haven't been incorporated. You want to be very gentle and use your hands as little as possible. Focus on folding the dough over onto itself until it mostly comes together.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat it into a 1 1/2-inch-thick disc. Using a sharp biscuit cutter, a round cookie butter, or a cup, cut out circles. Place the dough circles onto your lined baking sheets and brush the tops with melted butter.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until just barely golden brown. Let cool, then EAT.</span><br />
