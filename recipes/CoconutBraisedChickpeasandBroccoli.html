	Put the entire head of broccoli to use in this creamy chickpea dish with sun dried tomatoes, hot pepper, and ginger.  —Vicky | Things I Made Today

Food52 Review: Good! I was pleasantly surprised, being not a big broccoli fan. Lots of good flavors that melded together really well. Very comforting dish, and easily one-pan, and the lemon added at the end went a long way towards omitting any salt. Broccoli florets and stalks are diced and added separately, so it would have been a touch more helpful to have the word "divided" included in the ingredients list. Next time, I'll add some garlic at the beginning, maybe in between the onions and the broccoli stalks.
