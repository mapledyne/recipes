                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	This recipe was inspired by Deborah Madison's Vegetable Literacy, in which she details a recipe for a celeriac soup. I decided to put these beautiful, gnarly root veggies to use, taking quite a few liberties with the original recipe, adding a few potatoes for a more substantial soup. Then I added some mushrooms and a Dijon vinaigrette to the salad component â€“ once I open the door to one beloved ingredient, others are quickly incorporated, too, I guess. This is a perfect cozy and smooth little soup to usher in fall.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 - 2 lemons</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 celery roots</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 potatoes, medium Carola or Yukon Gold, peeled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 shallots, medium, finely diced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 celery stalks, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup parsley, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 garlic clove, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup white wine, dry</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Sea salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 cups vegetable or chicken stock</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon olive oil or other cooking oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon mustard, Dijon</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon vinegar, red wine</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons walnut oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 pounds cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup walnuts, roughly chopped and lightly toasted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup parsley, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">two bunches celery leaves</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Sea salt, black pepper</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Squeeze the juice of 1 to 2 lemons into a large bowl of cold water and keep it close by as you work with the celery root. To clean the celeriac, trim the leaves and the stalks (set them aside for another use, if you wish). Peel the rough, gnarly skin by cutting a slice off the top and the bottom (the way you would peel a melon or pineapple). Then, carefully slide your knife down the sides, taking the peel off as you go. Cut the celery root into 1/2-inch cubes and immerse the slices into the lemon water as you work.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Peel and dice the potatoes. Because the potatoes require slightly more time to cook than the celery root, be sure to cut the potatoes into roughly the same size or smaller. Chop the celery stalks into thin slices (and if they have leaves, trim and save the leaves for the salad below).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Heat the oil in a soup pot over medium-high heat. Drain the celeriac (discard the lemon water) and then add the celery, celeriac, potatoes, shallots, and parsley to the soup pot. Cook, stirring from time to time, until the vegetables develop some color -- about 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic, wine, and 1 teaspoon sea salt, and cook for a few more minutes until the wine has reduced. Add 6 cups of stock (or water) and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer, partially covered, for about 30 minutes or until the vegetables are tender. Take the soup off the heat and allow it to cool for a few minutes before transferring to a blender.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Blend or pulse the soup very briefly until smooth but leave a good amount of texture. Potatoes also tend to get gummy if blended too long.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Prepare the vinaigrette for the salad: In a small bowl, whisk together 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard, and 2 tablespoons walnut oil. Season with sea salt and black pepper.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Trim celery leaves from two bunches of celery. Rinse and dry the leaves and then set them aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Toast the walnuts lightly.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">8. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. When the olive oil becomes fragrant, add the mushrooms and saute for a few minutes, stirring frequently, until they become brown and begin to release some water. Add 1/4 teaspoon sea salt and some freshly ground black pepper and cook for a few more minutes, stirring often, until the mushrooms are fully cooked through. Toss the mushrooms, walnuts, parsley, and celery leaves with the Dijon mustard vinaigrette.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">9. Serve the soup warm and top each bowl with two heaping tablespoons of the salad. Both the soup and salad will keep in the fridge overnight. The soup may be safely stored in the fridge for up to three days.</span><br />
