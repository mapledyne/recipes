                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups beans, pinto or cranberry, rinsed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 cups chicken stock</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">leaves from 2 small sprigs rosemary, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">leaves from 2 sprigs thyme</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 sage leaves, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">12.5 ounces can tomatoes, chopped, with juices</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup bread, loosely packed white</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups tomatoes, finely chopped, with the juices</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">pinch of chili flakes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">black pepper, freshly ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 cups kale leaves, roughly chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 ounces pasta, small dried such as trofie tubetti or macaroni</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">olive oil, extra-virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Put the beans in a large pot and add enough water to cover them by at least 2 inches. Bring the water to a boil and simmer the beans for 3 minutes. Turn off the heat, cover the pot and let the beans soak for 2 to 4 hours.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Drain and rinse the beans, and return them to the pot. Add the chicken stock, 3 cups of water, the garlic, herbs and a large pinch of salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat, cover, and simmer gently for about an hour, until the beans start to become tender but still have a firm-ish bite.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Meanwhile, use a fork to mash together the bread and the canned tomatoes in a medium bowl. Set aside while the beans are cooking. Then, add this mixture, the chopped tomatoes, red chili flakes and black pepper to taste. Cover the pot, and simmer gently until the beans are fully tender, 20 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to keep the bread from sticking to the bottom of the pot. (If the soup seems too thick at any point, just add more water.) While the soup is cooking, bring a medium saucepan of salted water to a boil.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. When the beans are cooked, stir the kale into the soup and continue to simmer. Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook according to the package directions. When the pasta is just al dente, use a slotted spoon to transfer it to the soup. (At this point, you should not cook the soup any longer, as the kale will begin to brown, and the pasta will turn to mush.) Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve in warm bowls with a drizzle of good olive oil, a sprinkling of grated parmesan and toasted bread for dunking.</span><br />
