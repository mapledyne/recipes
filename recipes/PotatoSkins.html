	Note: If you have a potato whose skin or flesh has turned green, cut out those parts, do not use them. The green indicates the presence of a toxin that develops when potatoes are exposed to sunlight.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 small to medium sized potatoes, russet</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">olive oil, extra-virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Canola oil or grapeseed oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt, kosher, Diamond Crystal brand (exact)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">pepper black, freshly ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 strips of bacon</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 ounces cheese, cheddar, grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup sour cream, full fat</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 green onions, thinly sliced, including the greens of the onions</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1 Scrub the potatoes clean then bake the potatoes using your favorite method, either oven or microwave. If using an oven, rub with olive oil and bake in a 400¬∞F oven for about an hour until the potatoes are cooked through and give a little when pressed. If using a microwave, rub all over with olive oil and cook on the high setting for about 5 minutes per potato. I have found that baking the potatoes in a conventional oven yields potatoes that are easier to work with (cut and scoop out), the potato seems to adhere to the skins a little better, but there is hardly a discernible difference in the final product.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2 While the potatoes are cooking, cook the bacon strips in a frying pan on medium low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until crisp. Drain on paper towels. Let cool. Crumble.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3 Remove the potatoes from the oven and let cool enough to handle. Cut in half horizontally. Use a spoon to carefully scoop out the insides, reserving the scooped potatoes for another use, leaving about 1/4 of an inch of potato on the skin.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Increase the heat of the oven to 450¬∞F. Brush or rub grapeseed oil or canola oil (or another high smoke point oil) all over the potato skins, outside and in. Sprinkle with salt. Place on a baking rack in a roasting pan (don't use a cookie sheet, it will warp, use a roasting pan or broiler pan that can take the heat). Cook for 10 minutes on one side, then flip the skins over and cook for another 10 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool enough to handle.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4 Arrange the potato skins skin-side down on the roasting pan or rack. Sprinkle the insides with freshly ground black pepper, cheddar cheese, and crumbled bacon. Return to the oven. Broil for an additional 2 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly. Remove from oven. Use tongs to place skins on a serving plate. Add a dollop of sour cream to each skin, sprinkle with green onions.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Serve immediately.</span><br />
