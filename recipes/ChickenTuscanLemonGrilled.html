                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 x 3 1/2-pound chicken, boneless skinless, cooked, flattened</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt, kosher, Diamond Crystal brand (exact)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons (2 lemons) lemon zest, grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup lemon juice, freshly squeezed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon (3 cloves) garlic, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon rosemary leaves, fresh, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">black pepper, freshly ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 lemon, halved</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Sprinkle the chicken with 1 teaspoon salt on each side. Combine the olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, garlic, rosemary, and 2 teaspoon pepper in a small measuring cup. Place the chicken in a ceramic or glass dish just large enough to hold it flat. Pour the lemon marinade over the chicken, turning it in the dish. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Turn the chicken two or three times while marinating.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">When ready to grill, prepare a hot charcoal fire on one side of a grill (or turn a gas grill on low heat). Spread most of the coals across half of the grill. Place the chicken, skin side up, on the opposite side of the grill and place the dish you used for marinating on top of the chicken to weight it. Cook for 12 to 15 minutes, until the underside is golden brown.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Turn the chicken skin side down, weight again with the dish, and cook for another 12 to 15 minutes, until the skin is golden brown and the chicken is cooked through. Place the lemon halves on the cool side of the grill, cut side down for the last 10 minute of cooking. Remove the chicken to a plate or cutting board, cover with aluminum foil, and allow to rest for 5 minutes. Cut in quarters, sprinkle with salt, and serve with the grilled lemon halves.</span><br />
