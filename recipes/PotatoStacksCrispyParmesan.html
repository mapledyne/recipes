                <span itemprop="description">
	When the weather gets colder, I turn to baked potatoes for comfort. It’s the perfect excuse to turn on the oven and warm up the house. Besides who doesn’t want a side of roasted taters for dinner?
These crispy Parmesan potato stacks are a fun twist on your standard baked potato, and they’re surprisingly easy to make.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/8 teaspoon garlic powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 teaspoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 3/4 pounds potatoes, Yukon gold</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 tablespoons thyme leaves, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup cheese, Parmesan, shredded</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Preheat oven to 375F. Set an oven rack in the center position. Coat a standard 12-cup muffin pan with cooking spray or brush on a thin layer of oil.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. In a small bowl, mix olive oil, garlic powder and salt together. Set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Slice the potatoes: Rinse and scrub your potatoes. Slice each potato thinly, between 1/8 and 1/16-inch thick. I use a mandoline to get 1/16-inch thick slices.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Assemble the potato stacks: Place 4 slices of potatoes at the bottom of each cup of the muffin tin. Using a silicone brush, lightly brush the potatoes with some of the oil mixture. Sprinkle some thyme leaves on top. Continue stacking several layers of potatoes, brushing the oil and sprinkling thyme leaves until you have stacked all the potato slices. Each muffin cup should be filled to the top with potato slices.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Sprinkle half of the Parmesan evenly over the potato stacks.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Bake the potato stacks: Bake the stacks for 30 minutes, then pull out the potatoes and sprinkle the remaining cheese on top. Bake another 5 to 15 minutes, depending on how brown and crispy you want them to be (35 to 45 minutes total).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Transfer the stacks to plates or serving dish: Use a spoon to help release the potato stacks from the muffin pan. Season potato stacks with more salt and pepper, if you like. Serve immediately while hot and crispy.</span><br />
