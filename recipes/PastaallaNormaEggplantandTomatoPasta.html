                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	This dish, one of Sicily's most famous, is named after Bellini's 19th-century opera, Norma, which is widely considered the composer's best achievement. The final -- and most essential -- touch to Pasta alla Norma is a dusting of salted ricotta (ricotta salata). If you can't find ricotta salata, you can use Parmesan or caciocavallo -- but purists will point out that the flavor substitution isn't authentic. 

Don't skimp when salting and frying the eggplant -- the result is a wonderful sauce with a creamy, melt-in-your-mouth texture.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 eggplant, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt, to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">olive oil for frying</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 garlic cloves, peeled and squashed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">One 14-ounce (400 grams) can tomatoes, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">11 ounces (320 grams) pasta, rigatoni, penne, or maccheroncini</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 ounces (80 grams) ricotta salata, grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 basil leaves, torn</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Cut the eggplant into 1/3-inch (1 centimeter) slices. If you're using a large eggplant, you may want to cut these in half too. Sprinkle salt generously over the eggplant and let sit for at least 30 minutes (but better 2 hours). Rinse the salt off and pat the eggplant slices completely dry with paper towels. Deep fry the eggplant in about an inch of olive oil until golden. Remove the eggplant with a slotted spoon and drain the excess oil on paper towels. Set aside until needed.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. In the meantime, prepare a simple tomato sauce by gently heating 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet. Sauté the garlic cloves until fragrant but not colored. Add the tomato (it will spit and sizzle, watch out!) and about 1/2 cup of water, and season with salt and pepper. Let simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Towards the end, add the basil leaves and the fried eggplant. Remove from the heat.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Bring a large pot of water to boil. Add a heavy pinch of salt and cook the pasta until al dente. Drain the pasta, saving a little of the cooking water if you need to loosen the sauce slightly, and add the pasta to the warm tomato sauce. Toss, over gentle heat, until the pasta is well coated. Serve immediately, sprinkled with grated cheese.</span><br />
