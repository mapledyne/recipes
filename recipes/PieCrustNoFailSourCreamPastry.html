                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	I love this pie crust—distinct layers and big flavor for such little effort—, but it's definitely suited for particular circumstances. Elise of Simply Recipes doesn't recommend par-baking it (the sides will slump and shrink) and the flavor is noticeably tangy—which is something to keep in mind depending on your filling. I'll save this crust recipe for particular circumstances where a bit of tang would contribute to the final result, like cider caramel pie in the fall or a brown sugar peach pie in August.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups (260 g) flour, all purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 sticks butter, unsalted, cubed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup sour cream</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Cut butter into cubes and let sit for a couple minutes: Cut the butter into cubes and put in a warm spot to take the chill off (don't soften the butter, just let it sit out for couple minutes when you take it out of the fridge).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Whisk together flour, salt, sugar: In a large bowl, vigorously whisk together the flour, salt (omit if using salted butter), and sugar (if using).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Work the butter into the flour with your hands: Sprinkled the cubes of butter over the flour. Use your clean hands to squish the flour and butter together with your thumbs and fingers. Work the butter into the dough until you have what resembles a coarse meal with some chunks of butter.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Add sour cream: Add the sour cream to the flour butter mixture. Use a fork to incorporate into the mixture.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Form dough into disks, refrigerate: Use your hands to gather the pastry dough together into a large ball. Use a knife to cut the ball in half. Form into two disks.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Sprinkle all over with a little flour. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for an hour or up to a day ahead.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">If you want to freeze for future use, wrap again, this time with aluminum foil and freeze (leave in refrigerator overnight to thaw before using).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Remove dough from fridge, let sit for a few minutes, then roll out: After the dough has been sitting in the fridge for an hour, remove it and let it sit for 5-10 minutes at room temperature to become more malleable before rolling out.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">If it still feels too stiff to roll out, hold your hands around the edges to soften.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">To roll out, sprinkle a clean, flat surface with flour. As you roll the dough, check to make sure the bottom is not sticking. If it is, lift it up and sprinkle a little flour underneath.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Roll out to 12 to 14 inches wide, to an even thickness.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">You can use this pastry dough for unstructured rustic pies or galettes, or single or double crusted traditional pies. It can also be used for a savory pot pie.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Whether you use the dough for a galette or a double crust pie, it will be prettier with a light egg wash. Just whisk one egg in a small bowl, add a teaspoon of water, and brush lightly over the exposed crust with a pastry brush, right before baking.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Do not use this recipe if you need to pre-bake the pie crust. The the amount of sour cream and butter that make this crust so wonderfully delicious and flakey will cause the sides of the crust to collapse if you bake it without a filling.</span><br />
