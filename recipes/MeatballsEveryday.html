                <span itemprop="description">
	Last month, I had a breakthrough which I realize will not sound like anything wild, but the simple act of more than doubling the amount of egg I usually put in made a meatball that stayed together even if not fried first but that was still tender and completely amazing at the end. And now I can’t stop making them. You can serve them with anything that makes you happy — alone with a side of greens or salad, tossed with spaghetti but whatever you do, please do not do either of the following (unquestionably authentic) things: 1. Bake them “parmesan”-style the way you son likes from a local pizza place, i.e. with mozzarella and crunchy crumbs on top or 2. Find out what they taste like with a side of garlic bread or 3. Both, scooping one onto the other to form something of an open-faced meatball sub. Nothing good comes from knowing this combination exists. Trust me.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound meat, ground (I use a mix of beef and pork)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2/3 cup bread crumbs, fresh or 1/2 cup panko</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup milk or water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoon parsley, finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons cheese, Parmesan or Romano cheese (optional), finely grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons salt, coarse or kosher, divided</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Pinches of red pepper flakes or few grinds of black pepper</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon onion powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 eggs, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 garlic cloves, minced, divided</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 28-ounce can tomato puree or crushed tomatoes</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place meat, crumbs, milk or water, parsley, cheese (if using), 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, onion powder, eggs and half of your minced garlic in a large bowl. I like to mix all of this together with a fork, which does a good job of breaking up the eggs and chunks of meat. Form mixture into 1 1/2 to 2-inch meatballs and arrange on a plate. I like to let them set in the fridge for a bit — 30 minutes, if you can spare it — which helps them keep their shape.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Add remaining garlic and some pepper flakes and let sizzle until garlic is golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add tomatoes (beware the splatter!) and season with remaining salt. Let mixture simmer over low heat for about 10 minutes (with a thicker puree) or 20 (for crushed tomatoes, which are usually more watery), stirring occasionally.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">With stove on the lowest heat possible to maintain a gentle simmer, add meatballs to sauce one by one, and cover with a lid. It will be hard but please don’t touch or move them for at least 20 minutes of the 25-minute cooking time, so that they have a chance to keep their shape. Meatballs should be fully cooked through at 25 minutes, but it cannot hurt to cut one in half to verify.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Eat however makes you happy:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">— as-is.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">— with spaghetti: I’ll cook it very al dente, a generous minute shy of done, reserve a little pasta water, then once the spaghetti is drained, place it back in the pot with a splash of the water and a ladle or two of the sauce beneath the meatballs and cook it together over high heat for a minute. Tip spaghetti into a large, wide bowl, add the meatballs on top. Note: If your family likes a lot of sauce with their spaghetti, you might consider making the meatballs with an extra half or whole can. Just use what you need.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">— “parmesan”-ed: Place meatballs in a shallow baking dish with some of their sauce. Tear about 8 ounces mozzarella over the top and broil until melted. Finish with some parmesan, if desired, some breadcrumbs fried in a little olive oil and/or chopped parsley.</span><br />
