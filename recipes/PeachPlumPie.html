                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">For the pastry, add the ice to the water and vinegar in a 1-cup liquid measure and chill. Combine the flour, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Toss the cubes of butter in the flour. With a pastry cutter or a pair of butter knives, cut butter into the flour until the butter is in tiny pieces, almost the size of peas. Grab the vinegar water from the fridge. Drizzle 3 tablespoons of water across the flour mixture. Stir to combine, then drip over 1 more.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">With a clean hand, start squeezing fistfuls of the mixture together until it holds, then pressing that collected dough into the loose flour in the bowl. To get an idea of the motion, think less kneading more packing – this method will create delineated layers in the dough. Continue the process of folding and pressing dough together until all the flour is incorporated and the dough is fairly smooth.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Turn the dough out onto a work surface, divide into two portions, and shape each into a disc. Wrap them tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least two hours but preferably overnight. The dough can be kept refrigerated for three days, or tucked, wrapped, in a freezer bag and frozen for up to 2 months. Defrost dough overnight in the fridge, still bundled.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">To make the filling, add the lemon zest and juice to a large bowl. Cut the peaches and plums into 1/4-inch slices and add them to the juice, tossing slices often to prevent browning. There should be about 8 cups total. Stir in the sugars and leave at room temperature for 30 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Drain the juices from the fruit into a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring often. Reduce juices to a scant 1/2 cup. Scrape in the seeds from the vanilla bean and add the almond extract. Set aside to cool.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, line a baking sheet with parchment paper. On a lightly floured surface, roll one disc of dough out to a 12-inch round. Fit the dough into a 9-inch pie plate. Ease it completely flush to the corners with your knuckles, and leave an even overhang around the rim. Roll the second disc into another circle. Leave whole, or cut into strips for lattice. Lay second crust onto the parchment-lined baking sheet.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Sprinkle the cornstarch, spices and salt over the fruit. Toss gently until cornstarch is no longer visible. Pour in the reduced juices, and toss again. Tip the fruit into the pastry shell, packing slices tightly and mounding slightly in the centre. Top with second crust, whole or weaving into lattice.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Trim the top crust to barely overlap the bottom. Lift the edge of the bottom crust over to enclose the top, rolling inwards with even, firm pressure. Keep working around the perimeter of the pie, forming the edge slightly inside the pan’s rim. Crimp or flute as desired. Refrigerate the pie on the lined baking sheet for 30 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Preheat an oven to 425 F with a rack in the lower third. Glaze pastry lightly with beaten egg, then sprinkle with coarse sugar. Cut steam vents into whole crusts. Bake the pie in the hot oven for 25 minutes, then lower the heat to 375. Continue to bake until the pastry is evenly golden and the juices are bubbling thickly, 35 to 45 minutes more.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Set on a cooling rack and allow to come to room temperature before serving with ice cream, whipped cream or sweetened crème fraîche and ground pistachios, as pictured.</span><br />
