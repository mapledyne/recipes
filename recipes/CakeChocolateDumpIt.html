	My mother has many specialties, but her Chocolate Dump-It Cake is most beloved in my family. She kept this cake in the fridge, and it is sublime even when cold. I wrote about this cake in my second book, Cooking for Mr. Latte, but wanted to celebrate it here on food52, as well. - Amanda Hesser

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 ounces chocolate, unsweetened baking</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 pound (1 stick) butter, unsalted, plus more for greasing the pan</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups flour, all-purpose, plus more for dusting the pan</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons baking soda</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon baking powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon sea salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup milk</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon vinegar, cider</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 eggs</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon vanilla</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups chocolate chips</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups sour cream, full fat, at room temperature</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees, and place a baking sheet on the lowest rack, to catch any drips when the cake bakes. Put the sugar, unsweetened chocolate, butter and 1 cup of water in a saucepan. Place over medium heat and stir occasionally until all of the ingredients are melted and blended. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Meanwhile, sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. In a small bowl, stir together the milk and vinegar. Grease and flour a 9-inch tube pan. (If you prefer, you can grease it, line it with parchment and then grease and flour it. This is not necessary, but parchment does make getting the cake out easier.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. When the chocolate in the pan has cooled a bit, whisk in the milk mixture and eggs. In several additions and without overmixing, whisk in the dry ingredients. When the mixture is smooth, add the vanilla and whisk once or twice, to blend. Pour the batter into the tube pan and bake on the middle rack until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 to 35 minutes. Let the cake cool for 10 minutes, then remove from the pan and cool on a rack. (This can be tricky – if someone is around, enlist them to help. Place a ring of wax paper on top of the cake so you have something to grab onto when turning it out.) Let cool completely.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Meanwhile, melt the chocolate chips in a double boiler, then let cool to room temperature. It is very important that the chocolate and sour cream be the same temperature, otherwise the icing will be lumpy or grainy. (Test it by stirring a little of the sour cream and chocolate together in a bowl; if it mixes smoothly, it’s ready.) Stir in the sour cream, 1/4 cup at a time, until the mixture is smooth. Taste some! It’s good.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. When the cake is cool, cut it into two layers. Lay the top layer, top-side-down onto a cake plate (or whatever serving platter you like). Spread with icing. Top with the bottom layer, setting the bottom-side-up. This will give you a straighter edge (see photo of finished cake). Ice the top, sides, and center. (If you like a lot of icing, use 2 cups chocolate chips and 2 cups sour cream). My mother uses any leftover icing to make flowers on top. She dabs small rosettes, or buttons, on top, then uses toasted almond slices as the petals, pushing them in around the base of the rosette.</span><br />
