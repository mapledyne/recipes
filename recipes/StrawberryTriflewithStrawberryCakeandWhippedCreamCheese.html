                <span itemprop="description">
	As some of you may know, I am very fond of cake. Cookies are great, and pie has a saucy reputation that makes it attractive, but when I’m eating my feelings, I’m eating cake. Growing up in Alabama, with its family reunions, potlucks, and church cake walks, meant that I spent my formative years immersed in cake culture. Dotting that sea of boxed cake mix (there’s still a special place in my palate for boxed yellow cake mix), were the old schoolers, the pros, the bona fide Cake Ladies. These ladies are masters of, among other things, my personal unicorn cake: the classic southern strawberry cake, a concoction that typically involves strawberry Jell-O, which dyes the cake an almost fuchsia-like shade of hot pink, topped with cream cheese frosting in a slightly lighter pink. As far as I can tell, traditionally, there’s no actual strawberry in a southern strawberry cake. 

Still, this cake is my happy place. I spent years studying recipes, in search of a way to do it without Jell-O. Martha Foose got the closest of anyone I found in her book Screen Doors and Sweet Tea, and that was the starting point for this recipe. Once I adjusted it to my taste, I set about deconstructing it into my favorite vehicle for cake: the trifle. This trifle represents the best of summer to me, with its big heaping mounds of strawberries, cream cheese, and cake. It was the cake from my wedding, and we serve it every July for the Pantry’s birthday, in family-style trifle bowls that force our guests to stand up and put their backs into it while serving themselves and each other.

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">For the Southern Strawberry Cake:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter two 8-inch cake pans and line with rounds of parchment. Set aside. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside. In another medium bowl, combine the buttermilk, oil, and almond extract. Set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">- Split and scrape out the seeds from the vanilla bean. Rub the seeds into the sugar. In a stand mixer, beat the butter and vanilla sugar with the paddle attachment until it forms a paste. Add the eggs in a slow stream, beating well after each addition. Beat for 1 minute at medium speed. Gradually add in the buttermilk mixture and beat for 1 minute at medium speed. Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture. Mix until just combined. Stir in the pureed strawberries and the lemon zest.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">- Spoon into the prepared cake pans and bake until the cakes pull away from the edges and spring back when touched lightly in the center. Cool before removing from the pan.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">For the Whipped Cream Cheese:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">- Using a stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment, combine the sour cream and cream cheese and beat until thoroughly blended and smooth. Add all of the powdered sugar, lemon juice and zest, and salt. Mix slowly until thoroughly blended. Refrigerate until needed.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">- Just before assembling the trifle, pull the mousse base from the refrigerator. Whip the heavy cream until it holds a peak when you lift out a beater. Gently fold the whipped cream into the mousse base.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">To Assemble the Trifle:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1 8-inch strawberry cake, sliced into 1 to 2-inch chunks (recipe above)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1 recipe cream cheese mousse (recipe above)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2 pints strawberries, sliced and tossed with a few teaspoons of sugar until saucy</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">- In a trifle bowl, cover the bottom with cubes of cake. Layer on the 3/4 of the macerated strawberries. Spoon the mousse onto the berries and cake, smoothing the top. Just before serving, spoon the rest of the macerated strawberries on top.</span><br />
