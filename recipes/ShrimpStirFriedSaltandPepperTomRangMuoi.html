                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	Sean Wen and Andrew Ho started Pinch Crawfish Kitchen at the beginning of 2016 with a dream of bringing their beloved crawfish boils to the people (with help from the Triscuit Maker Fund). Since they take inspiration from their Asian-American backgrounds, their crawfish boils are influenced by flavors you'd more regularly find in Vietnamese or Taiwanese dishes. This recipe comes from co-founder Andrew for one of his favorite Vietnamese seafood dishes -- Tom Rang Muoi.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 lb shrimp or prawns, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup cornstarch</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 tablespoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoons chile pepper, red or green, sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup onion, green, sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup onion, white, chopped into 1-inch pieces</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons garlic, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon fish sauce</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 tablespoon butter</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons olive/vegetable oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Vegetable, for frying</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Lettuce and/or cooked rice, for serving</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 lime juice, fresh, optional for serving</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Using a knife, slice down the backs of the prawns to remove the vein. Depending on how daring your crowd is, you can either choose to cut off the legs and antennas or leave them on. Clean the shrimp in cold water and then proceed to generously toss them in cornstarch, covering them entirely.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Preheat a frying pan with oil to high heat, 375Â°F. Add the shrimp and let them fry in the hot oil for approximately 2 to 3 minutes or until they are golden and crispy. Remove the shrimp and place them on a paper towel.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. In a wok over high heat, add 2 to 3 tablespoons of vegetable/olive oil (preferably vegetable), the green chilies, garlic, HALF of the green onions, white onion, salt, sugar, butter, and fish sauce. Allow the garlic and onion mixture to cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the shrimp and stir-fry for another 1 to 2 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Serve immediately on a bed of lettuce as an appetizer or as a main dish accompanied by white rice. Use remaining green onions as garnish sprinkled on top of the shrimp. If you'd like a dipping sauce, just mix some salt and pepper with lime juice in a small sauce plate on the side.</span><br />
