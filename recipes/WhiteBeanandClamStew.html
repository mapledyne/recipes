                <span itemprop="description">
	You can (and should) make the beans the day before. Then gently reheat them as you make the tomato-pepper mixture and the clams. Save cooking the clams until the last minute. 

I tried to make this supermarket friendly. My rather average local market has clams all the time but you may want to call ahead to make sure your market has them in stock. For the beans, I like the Rancho Gordo brand. They really are the Cinderella of the kitchen. Perhaps you’ve heard of them. 

All of the components are delicious in this recipe but my guests raved most about the broth. Bean broth, white wine, clam juice and the vegetables all make it memorable.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">11/2 onions, yellow, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 cloves garlic, smashed and peeled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound beans, white dried (Alubia Blanca, Marcella, Cassoulet or Ayocote Blanco etc.), sorted and rinsed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 bay leaf</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 pound bacon, chopped into small cubes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon Chile Powder, Rancho Gordo New Mexican</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 ounces bell peppers, red jarred roasted, roughly chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 pound tomatoes, canned with their juice</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup clam juice, bottled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 cup white wine</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 pounds clams, cleaned</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">parsley, fresh flat leaf, for garnish</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a large pot over medium heat, saute ½ of a yellow onion and 1 clove of garlic in about 1 tablespoon of olive oil until soft. Add the dried beans, bay leaf, and cool water to cover by about 2 inches. Raise the heat to high and bring to a rapid boil for 15 minutes, then lower the heat and simmer until the beans are nearly soft. Add boiling water to the pot as needed to keep the beans covered by at least an inch of water. When the beans are nearly done, stir in salt to taste, then continue cooking until the beans are soft.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a large skillet over medium heat, saute the bacon until cooked. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside. There should be about 2 tablespoons of fat left in the pan. Discard excess fat or add a little olive oil for a total of 2 tablespoons.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In the bacon fat, saute the rest of the chopped onion and 2 cloves of garlic until soft, about 6 minutes. Add the chile powder and cook, stirring constantly, for about 3 minutes. Add the peppers and tomatoes with their juices and continue cooking for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add the tomato-pepper mixture to the beans and stir. Cook gently over low heat, stirring occasionally, while you prepare the clams.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a large pan over low heat, saute the remaining garlic in the remaining olive oil until the garlic is soft, about 4 minutes. Add the clam juice and wine and bring to a simmer. Raise the heat to high and add the clams. Cover with a lid and cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until the clams have opened. Discard any clams that remain shut and very gently add the clams, in their shells, to the beans. Add the reserved bacon and serve, scattering parsley over each bowl.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Serve with a green salad with a lemony vinaigrette and rustic bread.</span><br />
