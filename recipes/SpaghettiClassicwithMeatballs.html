                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	For our spaghetti and meatballs recipe, we wanted nothing short of great meatballs: crusty and dark brown on the outside, soft and moist on the inside. Focusing on ingredients for our meatball recipe, we found that milk did wonderful things for meatballs, especially when mixed to a paste with fresh bread crumbs. Still better was buttermilk, which delivered a delicious flavor. Eggs were also important for texture and flavor; their fats and emulsifiers added moistness and richness. Egg yolks alone worked best; the whites just made the mixture sticky and hard to handle, with no benefits. Another contribution to the flavor dimension can be gotten by adding some ground pork to the usual ground beef (usually chuck); we found 1 part pork to 3 parts beef to be about right.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 slices white sandwich bread (crusts discarded), torn into small cubes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup buttermilk or 6 tablespoons yogurt thinned with 2 tablespoons sweet milk</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 pound ground beef chuck (or 1 pound if omitting ground pork below)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 pound ground pork (to be mixed with ground chuck)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup cheese, Parmesan, grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons fresh parsley leaves, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 large egg yolk</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 small clove garlic, minced (1 teaspoon)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 teaspoon table salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Ground black pepper</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Vegetable oil for pan-frying (about 1 1/4 cups)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon garlic, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon fresh basil leaves, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt and ground black pepper</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound spaghetti</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">cheese, parmesan, grated</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. For the meatballs: Combine bread and buttermilk in small bowl, mashing occasionally with fork, until smooth paste forms, about 10 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Mix all meatball ingredients, including bread mixture and pepper to taste in medium bowl. Lightly form 3 tablespoons of mixture into 1 1/2-inch round meatballs; repeat with remaining mixture to form approximately 14 meatballs. (Compacting them can make the meatballs dense and hard. Can be placed on large plate, covered loosely with plastic wrap, and refrigerated for several hours.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Bring 4 quarts of water to boil in large pot for cooking pasta.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Meanwhile, heat 1/4 -inch vegetable oil over medium-high heat in 10- or 11-inch sauté pan. When edge of meatball dipped in oil sizzles, add meatballs in single layer. Fry, turning several times, until nicely browned on all sides, about 10 minutes, regulating heat as needed to keep oil sizzling but not smoking. Transfer browned meatballs to paper towel--lined plate; set aside. Repeat, if necessary, with remaining meatballs.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. For the sauce, discard oil in pan, leaving behind any browned bits. Add olive oil along with garlic; sauté, scraping up any browned bits, just until garlic is golden, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes, bring to boil, and simmer gently until sauce thickens, about 10 minutes. Stir in basil; add salt and pepper to taste. Add meatballs and simmer, turning them occasionally, until heated through, about 5 minutes. Keep warm over low flame.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Meanwhile, add 1 tablespoon salt and pasta to boiling water. Cook until al dente, drain, and return to pot. Ladle several large spoonfuls of tomato sauce (without meatballs) over spaghetti and toss until noodles are well coated. Divide pasta among individual bowls and top each with a little more tomato sauce and 2 to 3 meatballs. Serve immediately with grated cheese passed separately.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">MAKING MEATBALLS</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Mash the bread cubes and buttermilk together with a fork. Let stand, mashing occasionally, until a smooth paste forms, about 10 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Once all the ingredients for the meatballs are in the bowl, mix with a fork to roughly combine. At this point, use your hands to make sure that the flavorings are evenly distributed throughout the mixture.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Meatballs must be browned well on all sides. This may involve standing meatballs on their sides near the end of the cooking process. If necessary, lean them up against each other to get the final sides browned.</span><br />
