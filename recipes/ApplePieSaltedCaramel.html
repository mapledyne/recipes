                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Pate Brisee crust recipe</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Homemade Salted Caramel Sauce</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup sugar, granulated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 Tablespoons butter, salted, cut up into 6 pieces</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup cream, heavy</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Filling</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons lemon juice, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 large apples (use a variety for better flavor, such as Pink Lady, Granny Smith or Honey Crisp), , cored, peeled, and thinly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon cloves, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 and 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup sugar, granulated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg, beaten</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">for topping coarse sugar</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1.Read all of the directions before beginning the following recipe.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2.Make the Pate Brisee recipe crust first. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3.Make the caramel as you wait for the dough to chill.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat granulated sugar in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Sugar will form clumps and eventually melt into a thick brown, amber-colored liquid as you continue to stir. Be careful not to burn.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Once sugar is completely melted, immediately add the butter. Be careful in this step because the caramel will bubble rapidly when the butter is added.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Stir the butter into the caramel until it is completely melted, about 2-3 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Very slowly, drizzle in 1/2 cup of heavy cream while whisking. Since the heavy cream is colder than the caramel, the mixture will rapidly bubble and/or splatter when added.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Allow the mixture to boil for 1 minute. It will rise in the pan as it boils.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove from heat and stir in 1 teaspoon of salt. Allow to cool down before using.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cover the caramel tightly and store for up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator. Warm the caramel up for a few seconds before using in a recipe.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4.Next, make the apple filling as the dough is still chilling: Put the lemon zest and lemon juice into a very large bowl. Add the apples and toss gently. *Slice your apples a uniform thickness. You don't want some solid apples and some thin, mushy apples. In a small mixing bowl, combine the flour, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, and sugar. Pour over the apples and gently toss to combine. Set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5.Roll out the chilled pie crust: On a floured work surface, roll out one of the balls of chilled dough (keep the other one in the refrigerator). Turn the dough about a quarter turn after every few rolls until you have a circle 12 inches in diameter. Carefully place the dough into a 9x2 inch pie dish. Tuck it in with your fingers, making sure it is smooth. With a small and sharp knife, trim the extra overhang of crust and discard.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6.Fill the pie crust with the apples. There are a lot of apples, but pile them tightly and very high. Drizzle with 1/2 cup of the salted caramel, reserving the rest for topping.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7.Preheat oven to 400F degrees.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">8.Make the lattice crust: Remove the other ball of chilled dough from the refrigerator. Roll the dough out, 12 inches diameter. Using a pastry wheel, sharp knife, or pizza cutter, cut 16 strips 1/2 inch wide. I always use a clean measuring tape or ruler as a guide to assure the lines are straight. Carefully thread the strips over and under one another, pulling back strips as necessary to weave. Using a small and sharp knife, trim the extra overhang. Clamp down the edges of the dough with a fork or your fingers.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">9.Brush the lattice top with the beaten egg. A very thin coating - you don't want scrambled eggs on top of your dough. Sprinkle with coarse sugar.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">10.Place the pie onto a large baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes. Keeping the pie in the oven, turn the temperature down to 375F and bake for an additional 40-50 minutes. If the top of your pie is getting too brown, cover loosely with aluminum foil. The pie will be done when the caramel begins to bubble up. A small knife inserted inside should come out relatively clean.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Allow the pie to cool for 4 hours before serving. Drizzle the pie with the extra caramel sauce to serve.</span><br />
