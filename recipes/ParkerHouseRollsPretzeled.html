                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 envelope active dry yeast</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup warm water, at 110° F</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup butter, unsalted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 3/4 teaspoons salt, kosher</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup milk, whole, warmed just slightly</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 1/2 cups flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2  teaspoons baking soda</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg, beaten, with one teaspoon of water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt, flaky or sesame seeds, for sprinkling</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Whisk the yeast and water together. Let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the shortening, sugar, and salt. Whisk in the milk and egg. Add the foamy yeast mixture and stir to combine.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Add the flour and stir until a dough forms, then knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. The dough will be soft and will probably stick to the bottom of the bowl. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Preheat oven to 350° F, melt the butter, and brush a 9- by 13-inch baking dish with butter. Divide the dough into 4 pieces.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. On a floured surface, roll one dough piece into a roughly 12- by 6-inch rectangle. Brush the surface with melted butter and fold the dough over lengthwise. Cut the folded dough into 4 pieces. Lay the folded rolls in the prepared baking dish, slightly overlapping. Repeat with the remaining dough, then brush the rolls with butter. Loosely cover the pan with plastic wrap and let the rolls rise for 30 more minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Pretzel it! Heat oven to 375°F (190°C). If using the baking soda option, bring your water to a boil and slowly stir in baking soda — it will foam up. If using the food-grade lye option, do not heat your water, just stir the lye into the water in a sink, wearing gloves (see more precautions in Notes below).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Thoroughly brush tops and creases between rolls (as best as your brush can get in) with the lye or soda pretzel wash. Rinse brush and beat your egg with 1 teaspoon water. Brush the rolls a second time, this time with the egg wash. Sprinkle rolls with either sesame seeds or coarse salt. Use a sharp paring knife to make +-sign slashes in the top of each roll; you want to cut at least 1/2-inch down (I always make my cuts too shallow and they get lost when baked).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Bake the rolls until golden brown and puffed, about 20 - 25 minutes. Serve warm.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Salt-topped rolls are best on the first day. Sesame-topped rolls keep better, and can easily be frozen and stashed for future bread emergencies urgencies.</span><br />
