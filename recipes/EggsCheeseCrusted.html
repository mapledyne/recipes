                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	My brother came up with this when he saw a glut of cave-aged cheddar in his fridge. He also made it for me with Parmesan—I think any kind of hard or semi-hard cheese would work (Manchego, anyone?). Using the cheese's intrinsic oils instead of other cooking oils fries the eggs gently, creating a salty, crispy, cheesy bottom crust juxtaposed against the creaminess of the eggs on top. You can use finely chopped, coarsely chopped, grated, or shredded cheese, though you'll have a different distribution of cheese along the crust and it'll affect how quickly the cheese will cook/brown. It's like a choose-your-own-adventure kind of breakfast!

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup (or more) hard or semi-hard cheese, like cheddar or Parmesan, chopped or grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 eggs</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt and pepper, to taste</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. In a skillet heated over medium-high heat, add the cheese. As the cheese begins to melt and release its oils, crack the eggs into the skillet over the cheese and season with salt and pepper. (Go easy on the salt if you're using a salty cheese—unless you're my mom and love salt, then by all means, you do you.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. If the eggs don't cover all of the cheese, gently try to spread the whites over the cheese or scrape the cheese towards the egg. You don't want to lose that cheesy goodness! Cook the eggs until the whites are set, or to your preference.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Transfer to a plate and enjoy.</span><br />
