                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 x 6-inch lengths baguette or ciabatta, cut open the long way</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 garlic clove, whole, peeled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 large (12 ounces is ideal) tomato, halved, quartered or a few campari (golf-ball sized) tomatoes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">A couple tablespoons olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">sea salt, Flaky</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Both methods: Grill or toast your bread fairly crunchy as it will soften quickly under the tomatoes. The moment itâ€™s done, if you want it garlicky, rub the cut side with the peeled garlic clove. The heat and abrasion helps the garlic release its juices and infuses the bread. From here, the methods diverge.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">More traditional to what we saw in Catalonia: Rub your tomato over the toasted bread surface, using the rough edge to grate it a little to your desired level of tomato application (leaving the skins behind). Drizzle generously with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Cut into sections.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Less common, but good for making it for a crowd or if you want more tomato on top: Rub the cut side of your tomatoes over the large holes of a box grater set in a wide, shallow bowl. Grate only the flesh; leave the skin behind. Generously season the tomato mixture with olive oil and salt. Spoon it onto your toasted or grilled bread. Cut into sections.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Serve: Plain, or with jamon, anchovies, chorizo or as side to any tapa (such as potato tortilla) or salad.</span><br />
