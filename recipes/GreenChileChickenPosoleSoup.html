                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	I use mild green Poblano chili peppers for this soup. Eventually on the vine they turn red and when they do, they become very HOT. The green ones are relatively mild. All the ingredients are very fresh. But...you can use canned posole and canned peppers. But why? The soup is very simple to make and all the steps are easy. Shortcuts will greatly sacrifice the taste. The extra time to make freshly cooked posole and freshly roasted peppers is well worth the effort.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 pounds chili peppers, green Poblano</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound chicken, rotisserie, roasted or bbq'd</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups posole</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 medium onion, diced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 large bunch oregano, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 cups chicken stock</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cabbage, napa, shredded</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 or 4 cloves garlic, peeled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 lime, cut into wedges</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">to taste salt</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Soak the posole for at least 3 hours or overnight. Add 10 cups of water and about 3 or 4 cloves of peeled garlic and cook over medium heat for about 3 hours or until tender to the taste. Watch carefully as it is cooking and add more water as needed.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Roast the Poblano peppers over a gas flame, under a broiler or easiest of all , on the BBQ. After all sides are blackened, cover them in a bowl or place in a plastic bag or paper bag. Cool and the skins will slip off effortlessly. Remove the stem and the seeds.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Saute the onions in a little bit of olive oil. Roast the chicken breasts. (or BBQ them) Shred the chicken.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. In a blender, put the sauteed onions, the garlic cloves, about a third to half of the cooked posole, 3 tablespoons of fresh oregano, the peppers and 4 cups of the chicken stock and blend until smooth. (you may have to do a couple batches)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Pour the blended mixture into the pot with the remaining posole and add the shredded chicken and the remaining 2 cups of chicken stock and simmer for at least an hour. If the soup seems too thick, add some more chicken stock or water.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Shred the Napa cabbage and strip the leaves off the oregano. To serve the soup, ladle into soup bowls, put a small mound of cabbage on top and garnish with oregano. Serve with a wedge of fresh lime.</span><br />
