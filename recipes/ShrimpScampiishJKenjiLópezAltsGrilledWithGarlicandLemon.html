                <span itemprop="description">
	There are 4 simple tricks for better grilled (or seared) shrimp nested within this recipe, which add very little more time or effort and outsized success: air-drying, dry-brining, adding baking soda, and snuggling on the skewers. Feel free to mix and match anytime you cook shrimp—they will all pamper them to a degree—or use them all right here.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 1/2 pounds shrimp, large, peeled and deveined</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon baking soda</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon salt, kosher, plus more to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 medium cloves garlic, minced, divided</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup olive oil, extra virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon zest and 4 teaspoons lemon, juice from 1</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons parsley leaves, fresh, finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">black pepper, freshly ground</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Combine the shrimp, baking soda, salt, and optional sugar in a medium bowl and toss to coat. Thread the shrimp onto sets of 2 skewers, alternating heads to tails and pushing the shrimp so that they are nestled snugly together; you should have about 6 shrimp on each set of skewers. Lay skewers across the top of a baking dish so that the shrimp are suspended above the bottom of the dish. Transfer to refrigerator and allow to rest for 1 hour. Meanwhile, combine half of the garlic and half of the olive oil in a small bowl. Combine the remaining garlic, olive oil, lemon zest and juice, and parsley in a large bowl.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. When you’re ready to grill, brush both sides with the first garlic/oil mixture. Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set the cooking grate in place, cover the grill, and allow to heat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting, cover, and heat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate. (You can also do this inside in a grill pan, heavy cast iron skillet, or broiler, but be sure a fan is turned on!)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Place shrimp directly over hot side of grill and cook, turning occasionally, until shrimp are just cooked through and well charred, 4 to 5 minutes total. Transfer shrimp to a cutting board.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Carefully slide the shrimp off the skewers with a fork and transfer to the bowl with the garlic/oil/lemon mixture. Toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve immediately.</span><br />
