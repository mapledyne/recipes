                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	Spaghetti squash tend to be blander than other squashes, not quite as sweet and delicious on their own or simply seasoned with salt, pepper, and butter—they take well to bold seasonings. I've had success dressing the roasted, shredded spaghetti squash with butter, Parm, tons of parsley, and a squeeze of lemon as well as this bright, refreshing dressing, which is inspired from a Tamar Adler recipe for sweet potatoes that calls for chiles, lime, and cilantro.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 spaghetti squash, about 3 pounds</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 onion, red , small, finely diced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 chile, hot, finely diced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons lemon or lime juice or a mix of the two, freshly squeezed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon salt, Kosher or coarse, plus more to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons coconut oil, melted or olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup cilantro, fresh, chopped fresh plus more to taste</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Preheat the oven to 375° F. Place squash in a buttered baking dish or sheet pan. Use a sharp knife to puncture the skin in several places—this will prevent it from exploding in the oven. Roast for 60 to 75 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from the oven and let cool briefly.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Meanwhile, place the onion and chile in a small bowl and cover with 2 tablespoons of the lime or lemon juice. Season with a pinch of kosher salt.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. When squash has cooled slightly, cut it in half. Scoop out the seeds and reserve for another use. Drag a fork across the flesh of the squash, pulling up the strands. Transfer to a large mixing bowl. You should have about 3 cups. Season with 1 teaspoon salt. Pour the macerated onion and chiles over top. Pour over 3 tablespoons melted coconut oil and all of the cilantro. Toss and taste. Add more salt, if necessary, and another tablespoon of lime or lemon or coconut oil to taste.</span><br />
