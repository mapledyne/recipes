	When I think of the Silician sauce salmoriglio, I typically think grilled fish. But it’s pungent and flavorful enough to stand up to red meat, and it makes a great, quick marinade—perfect for when you haven't planned ahead or just want a good steak fast. For steak, I take a slight detour from traditional versions by adding the zest from the lemon I’ve juiced, fresh thyme (my favorite herb, and one I love with red meat), and red pepper flakes. Be sure to reserve some of the prepared salmoriglio to spoon over your cooked steak. Grilled vegetables make a natural side dish and taste great with the salmoriglio. (less) —EmilyC

Food52 Review: How could I not love this? Garlic, lemon, red pepper flakes, fresh herbs—salmoriglio was practically made for me. As a marinade, it works beautifully on flank steak, gently flavoring and tenderizing the meat. As a sauce, it's even better. It was a great dipping sauce for asparagus as well as steak. Super easy, with lots of flavor, this is a truly great recipe and one I will use frequently.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 garlic cloves, crushed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon salt, kosher, for marinade</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons oregano leaves, fresh, finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons thyme leaves, fresh, finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon hot pepper flakes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">lemon, Juice and zest from 1</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 pounds flank, skirt, or hanger steak</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. To make the salmoriglio, start by smashing together your garlic and salt with the side of your chef's knife, then work your knife back and forth to create a smooth paste. (Alternatively, you can do this step in a mortar and pestle.) In a small bowl, combine the garlic paste, oregano, thyme, and hot pepper flakes. Whisk in the olive oil, then add the lemon juice and zest. (Adding the olive oil first prevents the lemon juice from turning the herbs brown.) Season to taste with salt. Reserve about 1/3 cup of the salmoriglio to serve as a sauce.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. To prep your flank steak, remove the steak from the refrigerator and place it on a plate or sheet pan. Rub the remaining salmoriglio evenly over both sides of the steak, making sure to work it in well. Leave to marinate for up to 1 hour. Meanwhile, prep your grill.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. To grill your steak and serve, prep your grill for direct cooking over medium-high heat. Brush your grates clean. Grill the steak until cooked to your desired doneness, about 4 to 5 minutes on each side for medium-rare. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for about 10 minutes. Thinly slice against the grain. Serve with the reserved salmoriglio on the side. Enjoy!</span><br />
