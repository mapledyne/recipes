                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 peaches, ripe, medium, rinsed and patted dry</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons sugar, or more to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups wine, crisp dry white or rose</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Slice the peaches very thin (I aim for 12 - 16 slices per peach). Combine the peaches and sugar in a large storage container and toss gently to mix. Add the wine and toss gently again. Taste and if you like more sweetness, add sugar, a tablespoon at a time.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">When they are sweetened to your liking, cover and refrigerate for several hours or up to 1 day.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Serve peaches very cold, straight from the refrigerator, in short, wide glasses with a small ladleful of their liquid. Eat the peaches, then drink the liquid left in the glass.</span><br />
