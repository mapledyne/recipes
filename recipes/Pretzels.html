                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon yeast, instant</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon salt, kosher, Diamond Crystal brand (exact)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon honey</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup water, lukewarm</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons baking soda</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt, kosher or flaky sea, for sprinkling</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, stir together the flour, yeast and salt. Stir the honey into the water until it begins to dissolve, then add the honey-water mixture to the dry ingredients. Mix with the paddle on low speed until the dough starts to come together, then switch to the dough hook attachment and knead on medium speed (4 on the KitchenAid) for 4 minutes. If the dough is very dry (bits are refusing to incorporate) add an additional tablespoon of water.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Spray a bowl with cooking spray and place the dough in it. Spray a bit more cooking spray on top of the dough, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let rise 75 minutes, punching down the dough after 45 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Line a large baking sheet with parchment and spray with cooking spray. Divide the dough into 6 pieces (about 2 ounces each). It will be easier to form the pretzels if you cut the dough into strips with a bench knife rather than pulling off balls of dough by hand. Roll each piece into a LONG (18-inch) snake and form into a pretzel. Place the formed pretzels on the baking sheet.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Bring 2 quarts of water and the baking soda to a boil in a saucepan. Add 3 pretzels to the boiling water and boil 30 seconds. Flip the pretzels, boil an additional 30 seconds, and return them to the baking sheet. Repeat with remaining pretzels. Sprinkle the pretzels with kosher salt.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Bake 9 to 10 minutes or until deep golden brown. Cool pretzels on a rack and serve warm.</span><br />
