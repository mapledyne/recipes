                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	First of all, some confessions: This may be a six-minute meal for you, but some of us still had to be pains in the tuchus’ about it. I ordered a par-baked country loaf from Fresh Direct that first needed to be baked and cooled, before it could be rendered into croutons. (Could I be more ridiculous?) Then I fell all gaga over some cranberry beans at the Greenmarket yesterday, so I had to shell and pre-boil them before adding them to the dish. (Though canned and drained beans, or skipping the beans entirely, would also do.) And yes, I know asparagus season has really passed but that off-season stuff isn’t a quarter bad.

And now, some cooking notes: The asparagus will be very al dente, cooked in this method. We love it that way, but if you like yours with more give, you can start it a couple minutes earlier in pan or steam it for a minute or two before you add it. Marcona almods are fantastic if you can find them, but because I couldn’t, I used slivered almonds which burned easily — not recommended; use the whole ones. The beans are optional and not part of the original recipe, but we liked them in there a lot.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound asparagus, large, thick, firm lower third of the stalks peeled with a vegetable peeler or snapped off</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup olive oil, good quality</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 ounces chorizo, Spanish, cut into 3/4-inch pieces</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups bread cubes (croutons), 3/4-inch preferably from a baguette or country bread loaf</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup almonds, whole, Marcano if available</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup beans, cooked (optional; I used 3/4 pound fresh cranberry beans, shelled then boiled for 20 minutes in lightly salted water)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Make this right as you are ready to eat. Cut each asparagus stalk into 3 or 4 pieces. Heat the oil in a large skillet until very hot. Add all the ingredients except the beans, if using, and salt and pepper. Cover and sauté over high heat for 5 to 6 minutes (thinner asparagus might be done sooner), tossing or stirring the mixture a few times, so it browns and cooks on all sides. Add the beans, if using, and salt and pepper, toss again, and serve.</span><br />
