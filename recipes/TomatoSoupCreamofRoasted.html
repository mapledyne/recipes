                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	I set out to create a cream of tomato soup, turning to two food52 recipes for inspiration. I wanted to employ Oui, Chef’s technique (from his Roasted Red Pepper Soup with Corn and Cilantro) of roasting the vegetables to create the foundation for a soup. And I was looking to riff on The Weary Epicurean’s Tomato Bisque. In her bisque, The Weary Epicurean has you sear halved tomatoes in a pan before lavishing them with butter and cream. 

For my version, I roasted the tomatoes with a few cloves of garlic, then mashed the roasted tomato pulp with cream and cream alone. (Make sure you mash the tomatoes well, so you end up with a fine pulp, not chunks.) And then because I couldn’t stop myself, I made a rosemary-and-thyme oil to sprinkle on top.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 pounds (about 8 medium) tomatoes, beefsteak, cored and quartered</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 cloves garlic</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup olive oil, plus more for the tomatoes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 sprig rosemary</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 sprigs thyme</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 tablespoons cream, heavy</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">sugar, if needed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">black pepper, Coarsely ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 thick slices bread, country, toasted and brushed with olive oil, for serving</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Heat the oven to 375 degrees and line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Lay the tomatoes cut-side up. Add the garlic cloves (with skins on). Sprinkle with olive oil and season with salt. Roast until the tomatoes are soft and caramelized, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and let cool.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Add the ¼ cup olive oil, the rosemary and thyme to a small saucepan and place over low heat. Let warm until you begin smelling the herbs, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Peel the tomatoes and add the pulp and juices to a soup pan. Squeeze the garlic from its skin and add it to the pan. Place the pan over medium heat, and begin mashing the tomatoes with a potato masher until it’s pulpy, but not chunky (if you prefer to use a food processor, go ahead – just make sure you leave it pulpy). When the mixture is hot but not boiling, stir in the cream. Season to taste with salt. Add a pinch of sugar, if needed. Ladle into bowls and season with pepper. Sprinkle a little herb oil on top of the soup. Pass the toasts at the table.</span><br />
