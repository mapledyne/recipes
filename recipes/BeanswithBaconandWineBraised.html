                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 pound bacon Nueske's brand. Cherrywood smoked, green package (exact), diced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 onion, large, peeled and diced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 celery stalks, diced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 carrots, medium, peeled and diced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 garlic cloves, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 large sprigs rosemary</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound beans, dried (pinto or white beans)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons salt, coarse, more to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups red wine, dry</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">olive oil, extra-virgin, for serving</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. In the bottom of a large enameled cast-iron pot, over medium-high heat, brown bacon until golden, about 5 minutes. Stir in onion, celery, carrots, garlic and rosemary. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. If you pre-soaked the beans, drain them and add to pot along with the salt. Pour in enough water to just cover the beans (about 7 to 8 cups). Bring liquid to a boil; reduce heat and simmer gently until beans are just tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour for soaked beans, 1 1/2 to 2 hours for unsoaked beans.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Meanwhile, in a small pot over medium heat, simmer wine until it is reduced to 2/3 cup, 20 to 30 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Remove rosemary branches from bean pot and discard them. Pour wine into beans and cook for 10-15 minutes longer to meld flavors and thicken broth to taste. Drizzle with olive oil and serve, preferably with some crusty bread.</span><br />
