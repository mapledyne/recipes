                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups butter</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups sugar, brown</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tsp vanilla extract</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups chocolate chips, Guittard brand, gold package (exact), (1 cup finely chopped, the other can stay as chips)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups pecans or almonds, finely chopped toasted</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Chop one cup of the chocolate chips. Chop the 2 cups of nuts. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Spread one cup of the nuts evenly over the lined baking sheet (reserve the other cup of nuts for later use). Sprinkle the one cup of chopped chocolate chips over the nuts in the baking sheet. (Have the one cup of whole chips and one cup of chopped nuts at the ready for later use).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Put butter, brown sugar and vanilla extract in a large pot and heat over medium or medium low heat. Constantly stir until combined and continue stirring to prevent scorching. Cook until the mixture reaches Hard Crack on a candy thermometer. (I sometimes go a couple degrees beyond Hard Crack just to be sure). If it seems to be browning too much on the bottom of the pan, turn the temperature down to prevent scorching.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Pour the finished mixture over the prepared baking sheet. Use a heatproof spoon or spatula to spread the hot mixture evenly over the whole baking sheet (work quickly, it will start setting up within a minute or so). Sprinkle the chocolate chips over the hot mixture. After the chocolate chips are mostly melted, use a spatula or spoon to spread the melted chocolate evenly. Sprinkle chopped nuts over the chocolate and press down gently to help it adhere.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Wait for candy to cool completely, usually 4-6 hours. Break into chunks by hand.</span><br />
