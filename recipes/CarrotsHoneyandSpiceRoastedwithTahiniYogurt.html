This recipe halves easily, and I’ll bet it also doubles well. And if you use a scale to measure the ingredients by weight, it comes together very, very fast. Oh, and though the original version calls for Greek yogurt, I prefer regular plain yogurt, so that’s what I keep around, and it worked just fine.

To toast the coriander and cumin seeds, put a small skillet over medium heat, add the seeds (only one type at a time; they’ll probably toast at different rates), and stay nearby, shaking the pan occasionally. They’re ready when they smell fragrant. Remove them from the heat immediately, and crush them coarsely in a mortar and pestle or under the side of a knife. Repeat with the other type of seeds.

Optional: Add chickpeas and/or red onion

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">For yogurt sauce:</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Scant 3 tablespoons tahini, such as Joyva brand</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2/3 cup yogurt, Greek-style, plain unsweetened</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons lemon juice</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 garlic clove, crushed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Generous pinch salt, kosher, Diamond Crystal brand (exact), such as Diamond Crystal brand</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">For carrots:</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Scant 3 tablespoons honey</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 teaspoons coriander seeds, toasted and lightly crushed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 teaspoons cumin seeds, toasted and lightly crushed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Leaves from 2 sprigs fresh thyme, or a generous pinch thyme, dried</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 pounds carrots, peeled and cut into index-finger-sized batons</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 tablespoons cilantro leaves, chopped or not</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt, Kosher</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Black pepper</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Preheat the oven to 425°F, and line a large rimmed sheet pan with parchment paper.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl, and whisk well. Set aside while you roast the carrots.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Combine the honey, oil, coriander and cumin seeds, and thyme in a large bowl. Add 1 teaspoon kosher salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Whisk as well as you can; the honey might make it pretty goopy. Add the carrots, and mix until well coated. (I found it easiest to do this with my hands, since the honey wanted to clump instead of coat the carrots.) Dump the carrots onto the prepared sheet pan, and arrange them evenly in a single layer. Roast, stirring gently once or twice, until they are cooked through and glazed, 30 to 40 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Serve the carrots warm or at room temperature, with a good spoonful of sauce on top or smeared on the plate underneath them. Scatter with cilantro.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Yield: 4 servings</span><br />
