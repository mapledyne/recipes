                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	If you are using fresh peaches, it is a little bit extra work but I think it’s worth it. Simply cut an “x” on the blossom end of the peach (the tip of the fruit opposite the stem side) and dunk each peach into boiling water for 30 to 60 seconds before dunking into an ice bath. The skins should easily peel off.

If you'd like to make a very tight lattice crust, as I did, or if you want to decorate your pie with extra cut-out decorations, prepare 3 single crusts of dough (1 1/2 recipes of the Perfect Pie Crust) so that you're sure to have enough.

Elise's No-Fail Sour Cream Pie Crust also works well with this recipe.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 Pie Crust</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 pounds peeled and sliced ripe peaches (fresh or frozen), about 8 cups peaches, sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoons lemon juice</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Tiny pinch salt, kosher</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 tablespoon cornstarch</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon milk</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">sugar, sanding or any coarse sugar</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Prepare the pie dough through dividing the dough into two disks and chilling: Instructions for preparing your pie dough can be found here.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Roll out the bottom crust: Remove one of the chilled disks of pie dough from the refrigerator and let it stand a few minutes at room temperature until it is pliable.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Roll the dough out into a large circle, about 11 to 12 inches in diameter. Fit the dough into the pie plate and refrigerate while you prepare the filling. Don’t bother trimming the edges just yet; leave it until the end.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Make the peach filling: In a large mixing bowl combine the peeled and sliced peaches, sugar, cinnamon, lemon juice, and salt, folding gently to combine. Taste one of the peaches and add additional sugar for sweetness or lemon juice for tartness if you think it's necessary.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Sprinkle the corn starch evenly over stop and gently stir to mix it in.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Spread the filling into the chilled pie crust and place the entire thing back into the refrigerator to chill.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Roll out the top crust (and lattice weave, if desired): Remove the second pie crust (and third, if using; see Recipe Note) from the fridge. For a simple rolled-out top crust, roll the pie crust into a 9-inch circle and transfer it to the top of the chilled pie. Slash vents in a few places using a sharp knife.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">For a lattice crust, like the one pictured, and roll out the dough into a wide rectangle. Cut evenly-sized strips of dough -- I like to use a pizza wheel to cut the strips and a ruler as a guide (the width of most rulers is also a good width for the strips of lattice). Weave the strips into a lattice top for the pie.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Trim the edges of the top crust and the bottom crust, leaving enough bottom crust to cover the edge of the top crust neatly. Crimp the dough to seal the edges.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Chill the assembled pie in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. While the pie chills, preheat the oven to 400°F. Place an oven rack in the bottom third of the oven. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil to catch any pie leakage. Whisk the egg and tablespoon of milk together.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Bake the pie: Remove the chilled pie from the fridge and brush the top with the egg-milk mixture. Sprinkle with sanding sugar. Place the pie on the prepared baking sheet.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bake the pie in the bottom third of the oven for about 1 hour, or until the filling is bubbling in the center of the pie.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">8. Remove from the oven and cool completely on a wire rack before serving. If you'd like to serve warm pie, let the pie cool completely and the warm briefly in the oven before serving. (Or warm individual slices in the microwave.)</span><br />
