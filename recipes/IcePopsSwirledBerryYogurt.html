                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 level cups blackberries, fresh, or the berry of your choice</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons honey</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 lemon, or 1 small lime</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup sugar, granulated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups yogurt, Greek-style, plain unsweetened</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">If your berries are large, especially blackberries, cut them in half. Place berries in non-reactive (i.e. not aluminum or tin, which I suspect you weren’t using anyhow) bowl and squeeze 1 tablespoon lemon juice over it. Add honey, stir to combine. Set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place lemon peel, water and sugar in a saucepan. Cook, stirring, until it comes to a boil and sugar has dissolved. Gently simmer for 5 minutes more. Strain out peel and chill syrup completely. You can do this in the fridge, but I find it much quicker to set the bowl of syrup in a larger bowl of ice water. Within 15 minutes, it should be quite cold to the touch.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Whisk yogurt and chilled syrup together.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place the berry mixture and any juices that have accumulated in a blender and whirl until desired texture. (I left a few tiny chunks throughout.) If you loathe the seeds from raspberries or blackberries, puree fully and press through a fine-mesh strainer to remove seeds. Assemble popsicles by alternating pouring a little of the yogurt mixture, then a little of the berry mixture into each popsicle mold, repeating as desired until you reach 1/4-inch from the tops (to leave room for expansion as they freeze). Use a skewer to lightly swirl the mixtures together.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">If using conventional molds, snap on the lid and freeze until solid, 3 to 4 hours. If using glasses or other unconventional molds, freeze until the pops are beginning to set (45 minutes to 1 hour), then insert the sticks and freeze until solid, 3 to 4 hours. If using an instant ice pop maker, follow the manufacturer’s instructions.</span><br />
