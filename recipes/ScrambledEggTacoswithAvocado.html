                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	I make these late and often -- this is my back-pocket 10-minute meal after a very long day or a longer party. They're fast, good food you can eat with your hands. And because tacos often spill at random, you’re allowed to be slightly animalistic about the whole affair -- a very good perk, because no one has the energy for manners in the middle of the night. I felt odd making these in a well-lit kitchen and styling them for a camera -- they are at their best when cooked by dim, early morning kitchen light, and hastily -- but you’ll rectify that for me tonight, won’t you?

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tortillas, small corn</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 eggs</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 avocado, ripe</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">to serve sour cream, full fat</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">to serve hot sauce of your choice</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Blister the tortillas over an open flame until slightly charred in places. (Or, if you don't have a gas stove, in a very hot cast iron skillet.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. While they blister, start scrambling your eggs. (I like them scrambled pretty soft, in a small non-stick pan, but they're eggs -- they're personal. Cook them how you like them.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. While your eggs are finishing, divide about half of the avocado onto the blistered tortillas -- you can either mash it right on, or cut in slices and lay them down. Salt it lightly.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Pile on the finished eggs, a dollop or two of yogurt or sour cream, and a drizzle of your favorite hot sauce. Eat standing up.</span><br />
