                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	Feel free to use any combination of grilled vegetables and herbs you've got, but this one is especially good. As Bloomfield writes, "This is a chunky dressing that makes each bite of a salad taste different. The dressing is also good spooned over a steak and sprinkled with crumbled blue cheese, or dolloped onto a lamb chop with some feta." We also loved it spooned onto toast, stirred into pasta or potatoes or tuna salad. Adapted very slightly from A Girl and Her Greens

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 medium fennel bulb, outer layer and fronds removed, stalksroot end trimmed of brown bits</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 onion, red , small, cut into 1/2-inch thick rounds</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 radicchio, small head, (outermost leaves removed, bottom trimmed of brown bits quartered lengthwise) and cut into 1/2-inch</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup olive oil, extra-virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons vinegar, sherry</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon salt, flaky</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 garlic clove, small, very finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">A five-finger pinch mint leaves, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">A five-finger pinch marjoram leaves, fresh</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Halve the fennel bulb lengthwise and cut each halfway through the root nub (so the wedges stay intact) into about 1-inch-thick wedges.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Heat a grill or heavy grill pan over high heat until it’s good and hot, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and add fennel, onion and radicchio. Cook, turning vegetables over occasionally, until fennel and onion are lightly charred in spots and cooked through, but still have a little bite, about 20 minutes. The radicchio is done when the stems are tender but still have a little bite, the leaves are wilty, the tips crackly, about 15 to 20 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. As they finish, pop the grilled vegetables into a bowl and cover with plastic wrap until they’ve cooled fully. They’ll steam a bit and cook some more as they cool. Once they’ve all cooled, chop the vegetables into a mix of about 1/2-inch pieces, some smaller and some larger.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Pop the vegetables back into the bowl, add the oil, vinegar, salt and garlic, and stir really well. Toss the mint and marjoram together on a cutting board, give them a rough chop and stir them into the dressing. Store leftovers tightly sealed in the fridge for up to 5 days, though the herbs will fade.</span><br />
