                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	I have found that it's nice to have a neutral base for this ice cream. The flavor of vanilla bean ice cream gets lost. Chocolate is too dominant. My favorite is a brown sugar custard because it pairs nicely with the ingredients in the cookie dough. Feel free to use any chocolate chip cookie dough that's in the Toll House family for this recipe. Here's my favorite: https://food52.com/blog/9437-the-perfect-chocolate-chip-cookie. (Or go wild and use ginger snap, chocolatine, or snicker doodle dough. And please report back. I would love some inspiration.)

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups cream, half and half</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup sugar, light or dark brown</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 egg yolks</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon salt, kosher</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups cream, heavy</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup sugar, white</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 1/2 cups (12 ounces) chocolate chip cookie dough, chopped into dime-sized chunks, of your favorite, frozen</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. This recipe requires an ice cream machine. So make sure it's in working order. And if an insert is required, freeze it for 24 hours.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Prep the water bath so that all is in place when the ice cream custard is done: Place a fine strainer over a medium bowl. Rest bottom of the medium bowl in a large bowl. Add about an ice tray's worth of ice cubes to the large bowl. Set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together half and half, brown sugar, yolks, and salt. Set aside. In a medium-sized pot, over high heat, whisk together heavy cream and white sugar. Turn off the heat just as the cream starts to come to the boil.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. SLOWLY pour the hot cream into the half and half/egg mixture, whisking constantly. This tempers the eggs, allowing them to adjust to the change in temperature without curdling. Pour the mixture back into the original cream pot. Set aside your whisk and bring out a wooden spoon. Place back on medium heat. And start stirring. Don't walk away or you will have scrambled eggs. Watch and feel for the shift in viscosity. As you stir, the thin custard will slap against the sides of the pot like waves against the side of a boat. As it thickens, the gliding spoon will cause the custard to rise up and settle back down without much of a splash. This takes anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes. But don't time it. Just watch. To confirm that it's done, do the drag-your-finger-across-the-back-of-the-wooden-spoon test. It's ready when your finger leaves a lovely lingering trail. Pour mixture through the fine strainer into the medium bowl that's resting in the large bowl. Pour just enough water in with the ice cubes so that the ice water is at least half way up the side of the bowl filled with the ice cream custard. Leave bowl over the ice bath until it's cool. Stir every 10 minutes or so. Refrigerate custard for a few hours or overnight.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. I find it's easier to stir in the cookie dough if you use a baking dish with a wide surface area. Chill selected dish in the freezer.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Churn in ice cream maker according to manufacturer's directions. Removed chilled dish and cookie dough from the freezer. Move quickly. Evenly spread half the ice cream into the bottom of the dish. Use your fingers to distribute half of the cookie dough all over the top of the ice cream. With a spoon, try to position the chunks so that each big bite include dough. Top with remaining ice cream. Mix in remaining cookie dough using the same technique as the first half. Freeze for a few hours before serving.</span><br />
