                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">tortillas, flour</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">cheese, Oaxaca, grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">olive oil, extra virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">filling (mushrooms, green onions, black olives, diced tomatoes, cooked chicken, avocado)</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat a large cast iron frying pan to medium-high heat. Add a small amount of oil (or butter) and spread around the bottom of the pan. Take one large flour tortilla and place it on the pan. Flip the tortilla over a few times, 10 seconds between each flip. Air pockets should begin to form within the tortilla.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">When pockets of air begin to form, take a handful of grated cheese, sprinkle over the top of the tortilla, making sure that the cheese does not land on the pan itself. Add whatever additional ingredients you choose, but take care not to layer the ingredients too thickly.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan. The cast iron pan shock be hot enough by now to have plenty of residual heat to melt the cheese and brow the tortilla. After a minute, check to see if the cheese is melted. If not, return the cover and keep checking until the cheese is melted.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">When the cheese is sufficiently melted, use a spatula to lift up one site of the quesadilla and flip over the other side, as if you were making an omelet. The tortilla should be browned slightly. If it is not browned, turn the heat up to high and flip the quesadilla over every 10 seconds or so until it is.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove from pan and cut into wedges. Serve with lettuce, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole.</span><br />
