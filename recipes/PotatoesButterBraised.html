                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 pounds fingerling potatoes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup butter, unsalted, at room temperature</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon kosher salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 to 1/2 teaspoons black pepper</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 tablespoons sage leaves, or coarsely chopped large ones</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon rosemary, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">(or coarsely chopped large ones) garlic, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice (or sherry or malt vinegar)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">parsley, chopped and/or minced chives or scallions and/or rosemary or borage blossoms to garnish, optional</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Scrub the fingerlings, then cut into approximately 1-inch pieces. The pieces should all be about the same size so they cook at the same rate.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Heat a 12-inch saut√© pan (not non-stick) over medium-high heat. Cut the butter in half lengthwise. When the pan is hot, add the butter all at once. It's going to steam, smoke, and start to brown immediately. You may want to panic, but don't -- just have an exhaust fan going and proceed quickly. It will work out.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Immediately add the potatoes, even though the butter won't be fully melted. Arrange them in a single layer and season them with salt and pepper. Let them cook without stirring for 4 minutes. Stir, then rearrange in a single layer, turning individual pieces if they have an obviously raw side up. Stir after 2 to 3 minutes, then stir again after another 2 to 3 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Test one of the largest pieces. If needed, stir and cook a bit longer. Otherwise push the potatoes to one side of the pan, creating a small space to add the herbs and garlic. Add the sage and rosemary, and allow to fry for 15 to 20 seconds. Add the garlic, and allow to fry for 10 to 15 seconds. Then stir so the herbs and garlic are evenly distributed and the potatoes are in a single layer again. Add the lemon juice, and when it finishes hissing, remove the pan from the heat and give everything a good stir.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Transfer to a serving dish using a slotted spoon or spider. Try to get most of the herbs, but leave most of the butter behind. Garnish as desired, and serve immediately. (They taste delicious at room temperature, but they quickly lose their crispness. Feel free to go this route -- I promise, no one will complain!)</span><br />
