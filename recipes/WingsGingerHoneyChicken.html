                <span itemprop="description">
	I really wanted to save some of these ginger honey chicken wings to share with my loved ones. Buhhht, it didn’t happen.

That’s the problem when you are alone in the kitchen and you have in front of you something irresistibly good, and imagine that, you can’t resist!

Even after putting most of the wings in the fridge to give to friends later, the stash slowly disappears over the next several days, leaving nothing but an empty storage container as a guilty reminder of good intentions gone awry.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 pounds chicken wing drummettes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 green onion, thinly sliced on the diagonal</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 Tbsp sesame seeds, toasted  and cooled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup soy sauce</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 Tbsp honey</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1-inch piece ginger, peeled and grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cloves garlic, finely minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/8 teaspoon hot sauce, Sriracha</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1 Preheat oven, prepare roasting pan: Preheat the oven to 425°F with a rack on the upper third of the oven. Line a roasting pan or thick baking sheet with foil. Rub some olive oil or canola oil over the foil to keep the wings from sticking.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2 Prepare marinade sauce: Whisk together the marinade ingredients—soy sauce, honey, grated ginger, garlic, hot sauce—in a bowl. Set aside half of the marinade to be used as a sauce (about 1/4 cup).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3 Toss wings with marinade, place on pan: Place the chicken wings in a bowl and toss with the remaining marinade. Arrange the wings, skin-side down, on the foil lined roasting pan, taking care not to crowd the pan.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4 Roast in oven: Roast for 15 minutes, then remove from oven, use tongs to turn the wings over so that they are now skin-side up, and roast for another 10 minutes, until nicely browned. Check while roasting to make sure they aren't getting too dark. If so, place on a lower rack or cover with foil to finish cooking.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5 Toss with reserved marinade sauce: Place cooked wings in a bowl and toss with the reserved marinade sauce.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6 Garnish: Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds and thinly sliced green onions to serve.</span><br />
