                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup milk, (I’ve used skim with no adverse effects although it might be best to use one with more fat and body)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 eggs, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups all-purpose flour</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tsp baking powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 tsp salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 stick (2 ounces) butter, unsalted, cubed and chilled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 Tbs sugar, (I often choose the finely milled raw cane sugar—hippie sugar as I call it)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Flavorful additions of your choice, to taste (see above for ideas; if you use berries, make sure they are frozen)</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">This recipe was given to my sister by a good friend of hers who, appropriately, is Scottish. I pass it on to you only on the condition that you try making it first with something neat and non-wet, such as raisins, currants, dried apricots, citrus zest, or candied ginger. Wetter things, such as frozen berries, will send you into murky territory, and it’s best to learn the lay of the land first.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Beat together the milk and the egg and then set aside. In a large bowl, mix flour, baking powder, and salt. Rub the butter into the flour mixture, working until you have no lumps bigger than a pea. Add the sugar and whatever additions you choose, and stir or toss to mix. Pour the wet ingredients into the dries, reserving just a tad of the milk-egg mixture to use as a glaze. Bring dough together gently with a wooden spoon.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Turn dough out onto a lightly floured counter and knead it no more than 12 times. [Apparently, twelve is the magic number here; surpass it at your own risk.] Pat dough into a round approximately ½-inch thick, and cut into 8 or 12 wedges. Place on an ungreased baking sheet or a Silpat, if you have one. Using a pastry brush, glaze wedges.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until golden. Cool on a rack.</span><br />
