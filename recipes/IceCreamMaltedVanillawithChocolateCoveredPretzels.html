                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	We have gotten totally spoiled by living near a bunch of really good ice cream shops with all sorts of great flavors. A favorite of mine is malted ice cream -- in ice cream form, not in shake/frappe form. It may not be terribly sophisticated, but I adore malt (and malted milk balls), probably because we had a malt shop in town that made insanely thick malts -- complete with whipped cream, a wafer, and a cherry on top -- when I was growing up, and it was where we went for treats on warm summer evenings. Anyhow, back to the present. Earlier in the summer, our neighborhood ice cream shop (a.k.a. our after-dinner destination almost every day) had both malted vanilla and a chocolate ice cream with pretzel pieces. I had a scoop of each together, but what I really wanted was to have them combined into one flavor (plus the pretzel bits weren't coated in anything to keep them from getting soggy, and something definitely needed to be done about that!). So, ta-da! This is basically a malted version of Cook's Illustrated's vanilla ice cream with homemade chocolate covered pretzel nubbins swirled in. I usually don't use corn syrup in anything, but I've got to say, it does a nice job of keeping the ice cream from freezing too hard. (less) —fiveandspice

Food52 Review: WHO: Fiveandspice is a grad student, writer, cook, photographer, and a Food52 contributor living in Duluth, Minnesota. 
WHAT: Your new favorite ice cream flavor. 
HOW: Make a malted vanilla ice cream base, fold in homemade dark-chocolate covered pretzels, and freeze. Eat by the pint. 
WHY WE LOVE IT: This ice cream has its ratios down perfectly: the base is rich, creamy, custardy, the pretzels salty and bitter-sweet, the ideal mixture of the two on every spoonful. And believe us: we tried many, many spoonfuls.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 cup pretzel sticks, salted, broken into little bits</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces chocolate, dark, finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon butter, at room temperature</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 3/4 cups cream, heavy</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/4 cups milk, whole</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup corn syrup, light</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 egg yolks</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2/3 cup malt powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon vanilla extract</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Line a rimmed baking sheet with wax paper. Gently melt the chocolate in a double boiler or in the microwave. Stir in the butter until the mixture is smooth and the butter has completely disappeared.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Drop the pretzel bits into the chocolate and stir until all the pretzel pieces are coated. Then, using a fork, lift the pretzel bits out of the chocolate several at a time and push them onto the lined baking sheet, trying to make sure the individual pieces are separated from each other, for the most part. Transfer to the refrigerator to chill until the chocolate has hardened. Store in an airtight container until ready to use.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Combine the cream, milk, 1/4 cup of sugar, corn syrup, and salt in a heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat to a bare simmer, then turn the heat down. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, malt powder, and the remaining 1/4 cup sugar.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. When the cream mixture is hot, whisk a ladleful of the hot cream into the egg yolks (whisk vigorously!) to temper them. Repeat with one or two more ladlefuls. Then, pour the egg mixture into the pot with the rest of the cream mixture.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Cook the custard mixture over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until it has thickened to a custard texture and coats the back of a spoon (it will be around 180 F). Pour the custard through a fine mesh strainer into a large metal bowl, then stir in the vanilla.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. You can chill your custard over an ice bath, but I have hated ice baths ever since organic chemistry (I don't like bain-maries much either for the same reason). I just stick mine, covered, into the fridge and leave it overnight or until it is completely chilled.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Transfer your custard to your ice cream machine and process according to the manufacturer's instructions until it reaches the consistency of soft serve, adding the pretzel bits in the last minute or so of churning.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">8. Eat immediately (mmmm, soft serve), or transfer to an airtight container and chill for a couple hours until firm.</span><br />
