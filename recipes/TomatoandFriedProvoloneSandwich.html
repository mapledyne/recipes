                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	I didn’t buy fancy or aged provolone to make this, although they may have worked better. I wanted to know if it would work with the most unsung and readily available type, the kind that comes presliced and usually hangs out in the packaged deli meats aisle. It was thinner than the 1/4-inch slices Hess recommends, so I used two together at once. It was definitely a mess once heated, more of a puddle that I scraped off the frying pan (nonstick is your friend here) and flipped than a lovely browned underside. I assumed that it would go in the trash and we’d never speak of this, but the parts that had browned look — and tasted — amazing. Not a speck was wasted. I suspect most of us already know how to make the perfect summer tomato sandwich, but should be looking for a little something extra on yours today, mess or not, may we highly recommend some fried cheese?

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 1/2-inch thick slices bread, your favorite sturdy</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 tablespoons butter, (or mayo)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Two to four 1/4-inch slices cheese, provolone, (use larger amount for smaller slices)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tomatoes, ripe, sliced medium-sized perfectly ripe</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Flaky salt and freshly cracked black pepper, to taste</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Spread each slice of bread with butter or mayonnaise and set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat a skillet, preferably nonstick, over medium-low heat. Add a thin layer of olive oil and let it heat until shimmering. Add first slice of provolone to skillet and fry it until crusty and golden underneath. Using a very thin spatula (the “flexible fish spatula” style is my favorite, for everything) carefully flip slice. It’s probably not going to flip neatly and you’ll probably curse me and also Hess but a messy slice will taste no less delicious than a photogenic one, promise. Just do your best. Fry the slice on the other side until golden underneath, then lift this browned cheese mess out of the pan and onto your first prepared bread slice. Repeat with remaining slices of cheese, frying more than one at a time if you’re now more comfortable with the process.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Arrange slices of tomatoes over fried provolone on bread, sprinkle with salt and pepper and eat with two hands, from a plate, sitting down with a napkin on your lap, you civilized thing (if you’re not me, clearly).</span><br />
