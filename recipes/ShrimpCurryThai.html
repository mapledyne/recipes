                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">14 oz can coconut milk, full-fat (Mae Ploy brand preferred)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons curry paste, green (Mae Ploy brand preferred)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon sugar, palm (or brown)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon fish sauce</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound shrimp, large, peeled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">to taste basil leaves, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon lime juice, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups rice, basmati brown, to serve</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">vegetables, frozen, (optional)</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. If you think of it, refrigerate the can of coconut milk overnight. This helps it separate into thin and thick milk. Open the can and pour off the watery, thin coconut milk into a bowl. Add the thick, chunky coconut milk to the saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. (If your coconut milk doesn't want to separate, don't worry about it; just pour half in the saucepan and reserve half).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Add the curry paste and stir to dissolve. Cook until the coconut milk is thick and fragrant and hisses when you stir, about 3 minutes. (The coconut milk may begin to separate into oil and solids; that is not a problem). Add the vegetables and heat through if using. Add the palm sugar, fish sauce and reserved thin coconut milk and bring to a boil, stirring frequently, until the shrimp is just opaque throughout, 1 1/2 to 3 minutes (Test by removing a shrimp and cutting it in half).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Off the heat, stir in the basil leaves and lime juice and serve with rice.</span><br />
