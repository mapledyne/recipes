                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	Riva's recipe is appealing in its straightforwardness: all she calls for are 1 pound of strawberries, 1 pound of rhubarb, sugar (1 3/4 cups of it) and water. While I loved the concept, her compote was a little sweet for my taste, and I had some ideas for a possible riff. The second time around, I added less sugar (I used turbinado, which I think gives the compote a caramel undertone), infused the compote with some orange peel, and splashed in a glug or two from the open bottle of rosé that was lying around in my fridge. The compote, cooked just until the fruit started to fall apart but had not yet become a complete mush, was tart and fresh, perfumed with the oils from the orange peel, and it had just enough sweetness to keep your mouth from puckering.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cups rhubarb, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound strawberries,frozen or fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 tablespoons sugar, raw</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Pinch of salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Peel from 1/2 large orange, navel, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons wine, rosé</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Combine all of the ingredients in a medium saucepan and add 1/4 cup water. Set over medium heat and bring to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Cook gently, uncovered, for about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding more water if the mixture seems too dry. You want the fruit to cook through and soften without completely losing its texture.</span><br />
