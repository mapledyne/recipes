                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	Before food editor and stylist Paul Grimes came up with this recipe, we admit that we had never thought of making French toast with buttermilk. But when he whipped up a batch using the leftover buttermilk from the Skillet Corn Bread , we were shocked by how delicious it was. It turns out that the buttermilk permeates the challah with a subtle tang that partners beautifully with dusky maple syrup. Consider us converted.

<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 eggs, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons sugar, white</span><br />
