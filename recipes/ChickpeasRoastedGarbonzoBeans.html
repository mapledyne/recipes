                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cans garbonzo beans</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">spices, to taste</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Preheat oven to 425. Start with 2 cans of chick peas, drain and rinse them. Line a big baking pan with tin foil for baking and easy clean up. Lay a paper towel over the tin foil and drop the chick peas on top of the paper towel. Roll them around with another paper towel on top to dry. Remove all paper towels.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Toss around in olive oil and your choice of seasonings. I used Lowry’s season salt, celery salt, and garlic powder. Bake in the oven for 15- 20 minutes. They should come out with crunchy skin. Add a little more season salt to taste and a little shaved parmesan cheese if you’d like. Eat them warm and leave them out for healthy snacking.</span><br />
