                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	"I hate squash. You couldn't pay me to eat it." So said my friend Melissa. "Five bucks says you'll love this," I replied, handing over one of the slices of delicata squash you see below. She ate it -- and liked it. 

What's there not to like? You can even eat the skin. (In fact, it's my favorite part.) As far as I'm concerned, delicata squash, simply roasted with olive oil is better than candy. Don't believe me? Just try it yourself.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 (~1 lb) squash, delicata</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">olive oil, extra-virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">liberally salt and ground black pepper to taste</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Buy delicata squash (about one pound). Torque oven to 400 degrees. Scrub the squash clean with a vegetable brush. Slice off the ends, cut the squash into 1/2-inch rounds, and use a paring knife to remove the seeds.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Spill some olive oil onto a rimmed baking sheet, flip the squash over so each slice gets oiled, season liberally with salt and pepper and roast until they're brown and caramelized (40 minutes, more or less), turning once half-way through.</span><br />
