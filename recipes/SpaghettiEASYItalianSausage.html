                <span itemprop="description">
	The beauty of this spaghetti recipe is that it is very easy to make and you don’t have to add any seasoning to achieve wonderful flavor. The sauce gets all of its seasoning from two Italian sausages—one sweet, one spicy.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 Tbsp olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 onion, yellow,  finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cloves garlic, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 ounces sausage, Italian sweet</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 ounces sausage, Italian hot and spicy</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 large can tomatoes, whole peeled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound pasta, spaghetti</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">parmesan cheese, freshly grated</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">The Sauce:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1 Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet on medium or medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook a minute more.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2 While the onions are cooking, put a large pot of salted water on to boil for the pasta (4 quarts water, 2 Tbsp salt).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3 Remove the cooked onion and garlic from the pan and set aside. Remove the sausage meat from the casings (if your sausage is in links) and add to the pan, breaking up the meat with your fingers as you add it to the pan. Cook on medium to medium high heat until lightly browned.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4 Lightly purée the whole peeled canned tomatoes (and juices) in a blender, and add to the skillet with the sausage meat. Add the cooked onions and garlic.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5 Once the pasta water has come to a rolling boil, add the spaghetti pasta. Allow the water to return to a rolling boil. Cook, uncovered, with a vigorous boil, for as long as the directions on the pasta package say, usually about 10-12 minutes. When pasta is al dente (cooked but still a little firm), remove the pot from the heat. Drain the pasta and place it in a serving bowl.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Serve immediately. Toss with the sauce and garnish with grated Parmesan cheese.</span><br />
