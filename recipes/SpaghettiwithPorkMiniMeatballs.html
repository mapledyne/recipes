                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">For the meatballs:</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 slices bread, white sandwich, crusts removed, torn into pieces</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup milk</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg, large, beaten</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 ounces cheese, Parmagiano Reggiano, grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons oregano, fresh, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cloves garlic, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoons salt, kosher, Diamond Crystal brand (exact)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">to taste pepper</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 lb pork, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">For the sauce:</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons olive oil, extra-virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cloves garlic, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">28 oz can tomatoes with juice</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon tomato paste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoons sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">to taste salt and black pepper</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 lb spaghetti pasta, whole wheat</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. In a bowl, combine the bread and milk and mash with a fork until it forms a paste. Stir in the egg, cheese, oregano, garlic, salt and pepper. Add the pork and mix (hands work well) until well combined.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Heat the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet or cast iron pot over medium-high. Drop 1 tablespoon dollops of meat mixture into the skillet (the meat mixture will be too soft to form meatballs ahead of time, and they'll come out a bit like thick sausage patties. Yes, they're supposed to be like that). Working in two batches, brown the meatballs on two sides, about 2 minutes per side, and transfer to a plate.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Add the remaining garlic and cook until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste and sugar and bring to a boil. Cover over medium-high 10 minutes, until thickened, reducing heat if the sauce spatters too much. Return the meatballs to the pan, reduce heat to medium-low, and cover. Cook for 10 minutes or until the meatballs are cooked through, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente. Combine the pasta, sauce and meatballs and serve.</span><br />
