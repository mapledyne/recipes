                <span itemprop="description">
	Can't decide whether to make a grilled cheese or an egg in a hole? Make both! 

For this recipe, I use a pro-tip I learned from Five Guys: use mayonnaise instead of butter on the outside of the grilled cheese. It's way more spreadable and adds just a little oomph of flavor to the sandwich. (less)

Food52 Review: A nice way to add some more protein to a grilled cheese, while also providing something of a sauce from the egg yolk (depending on how you cook your egg).

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 slices bread, soft, like white or potato</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoons butter</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 slices cheese, sharp white cheddar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">pepper black, freshly ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt, sea</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Start heating a non-stick pan on medium-low. Spread a thin layer of butter on one slice of bread and place the bread butter-side down in the pan.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Cut the cheese into thirds. Place one-third on each side of the bread in the pan. Cut the remaining third in half and fill in the top and bottom of the gap between the other slices of cheese, leaving a cheese-less square in the middle. [Editors' note: You want to cover the entire slice of bread except for the square in the center where you'll be cutting a hole through the sandwich.]</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Spread a thin layer of mayonnaise on the other slice of bread and place it on top of the cheese, mayonnaise-side up. Cook the sandwich for a few minutes until the bottom is golden brown.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Flip the sandwich over. Using a cookie cutter or a drinking glass, cut out a hole in the middle of the sandwich about 2 1/2- to 2 3/4-inches wide. Remove the circle of bread (you can continue grilling this on the side of the pan) and crack the egg into the hole. Cover and cook until the egg is set to your liking.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Slide the sandwich onto a plate. Season the egg with freshly ground pepper and sea salt (I used a red Alaea salt, which is why the egg looks like it has measles). Serve with tomato soup, if you like.</span><br />
