                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Neutral vegetable oil, for greasing</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tsp instant (rapid rise) yeast</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 1/2 cups water at room temperature</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 3/4 cups whole-wheat flour</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup flaxseeds (optional)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 tsp kosher salt</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1.Oil the inside of two 9 x 5 in. metal loaf pans.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2.In a large bowl, mix yeast, liquid, flours, seeds, and salt. (I put the yeast and liquid in last.) Scrape dough into pans.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3.Drape with a clean, damp dish towel and let rise until level with the top of the pans. Note: This can take as little as two hours or as long as five; don't worry too much about the time, as the bread will rise at its own pace. Many recipes specify plastic wrap to cover rising bread; I don' use it because a) it's plastic, and b) it never stays in place. Occasionally this dough rises extra high and sticks to the towel; just pull it off the best you can. In the prospect of this bothers you, cover with lightly oiled plastic wrap instead.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4.Preheat oven to 450 degrees F and bake for 30 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5.Remove bread from pans, return loaves to oven and bake directly on racks for 15 minutes more. The bread is done when richly colored and hollow when tapped.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6.Let it cool before slicing.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Store in a paper bag for up to a week or wrap tightly and freeze.</span><br />
