                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	This is a simple white cake with a patriotic surprise inside. First thing's first, you need five 9-inch cakes: two white, two red, and one blue. You can use the recipe here, or any favorite white cake recipe that you have. After making a large amount of cake, the rest is pie (or at least easy as pie). 

Please note that the recipe makes one single cake, so to make the flag cake you'll need to make it 5 times. A standard KitchenAid mixer comfortably handles 1 batch of batter.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 tablespoons butter, room temperature</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/4 cups sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 eggs, room temperature</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon vanilla extract</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups flour, cake, sifted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon baking powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 cup buttermilk, room temperature</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 sticks butter, unsalted, softened</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 cups sifted powdered sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon vanilla extract</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup heavy cream</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Preheat the oven to 350° F. Grease and flour a 9-inch cake pan.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, 4-5 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, scraping well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. In a large bowl, whisk the sifted flour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt to combine. Add 1/3 of the dry ingredients to the butter mixture and mix just until incorporated. Follow with 1/3 of the buttermilk and mix to combine. Repeat until all of the wet and dry ingredients are added, scrape well to ensure the batter is smooth.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. For the white cakes: do nothing! The batter can be baked as is. For the red cakes: add about 25 drops of liquid food coloring (or more if it looks too pale). For the blue cake: add about 20 drops of liquid food coloring (or more if it looks too pale).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pans and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes. Cool in the pans for 15 minutes, then invert onto a wire rack and cool completely.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. To assemble the cake, you'll need the frosting (recipe below). Cut the white and red cakes into even layers, between 3/4- to 1-inch thick. Now you should have 6 layers. Use a 5-inch circle cookie cutter (or trace around a 5-inch plate) to cut one of the white layers and one of the red layers into a smaller circle.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Use the 5-inch cutter to remove the center of the thicker blue cake. This cake will remain in one thick layer.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">8. To build the cake, start with a large red layer and spread a thin coating of buttercream on top. Top with a white layer, and spread buttercream thinly on top. (The recipe is below.) Repeat with another red and another white layer -- four layers total.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">9. Top this white layer with the thick blue layer (center removed). Spread a thin amount of frosting on the 5-inch red layer, and top it with the 5-inch white layer. Now push and pat the 5-inch layers inside the hole of the blue layer. Now the cake has been assembled!</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">10. Frost the cake with the remaining frosting, using a small offset spatula to make it swirly. All that’s left to do is eat it!</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">11. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, 5 to 6 minutes. Beat in the vanilla. Add the cream gradually, mixing until a smooth, creamy texture.</span><br />
