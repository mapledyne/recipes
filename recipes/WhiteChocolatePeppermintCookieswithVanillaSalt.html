                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1⁄2 cup butter, unsalted, at room temperature</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons sugar, granulated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons sugar, turbinado</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3⁄4 cup plus 2 tablespoons packed sugar, dark brown</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg, at room temperature</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon vanilla extract</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 3⁄4 cups flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3⁄4 teaspoon baking soda</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1⁄2 teaspoon kosher salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup chocolate chips, white</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons peppermint candies (or candy canes), crushed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt, vanilla (such as Jacobsen), for finishing</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a medium bowl, cream the butter and sugars together with an electric mixer on medium speed, until light in color and texture, 5 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the egg and vanilla and mix well to combine. Again, stop the machine and scrape down the bowl with a spatula.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, and salt to combine.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">With the mixer on low, slowly add the flour mixture. Mix until streaks of flour still run throughout. Add the chocolate and peppermint candies then mix until everything just comes together. Finish the dough by hand, taking care to scrape the sides and the bottom of the bowl to make sure everything is evenly distributed.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">At this point, it is best to refrigerate the dough for 24 hours. Resting the dough intensifies the deep toffee flavors, and the texture of the baked cookie improves.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 360°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Scoop the dough onto the baking sheets. Top the cookies with a pinch of vanilla salt just before baking.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bake for 10 to 12 minutes. Rotate the sheets halfway through if they appear to be baking unevenly. The cookies should be lightly golden on the outside but still look quite gooey on the inside. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for at least 5 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to finish cooling.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">These are best eaten the day of baking but will keep, if well sealed, for up to 2 days.</span><br />
