<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1.Using your food processor, combine the flour, salt and olive oil and pulse for about 3 to 4 seconds. While the food processor is running, slowly pour the very cold water over the flour and keep running until the pastry begins to come together, after about 7 to 8 seconds. Do not overwork the dough.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2.Next, add in the fresh thyme and freshly grated cheddar and pulse just a few times so that the thyme and cheddar become incorporated into the dough. (Alternatively, you can add the thyme and cheddar later and knead it in before you place into the refrigerator.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3.Transfer the olive oil pastry dough to a lightly floured work surface, knead just a few times, gather to form a ball and wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before rolling it out.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4.Preheat your oven to 400 degrees. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and roll out on a lightly floured work surface.Transfer dough to a pie plate, gently pressing the olive oil pastry into the pie plate. Prick the dough with a fork and bake it for about 12 to 15 minutes or until lightly browned.Remove from the oven and lower the oven temperature to 375 degrees.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">For the quiche:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1.Combine the eggs, heavy cream, thyme, salt, and nutmeg and mix together well. Add in the cheddar cheese and the apples and mix again. Pour the filling into your olive oil pastry crust, sprinkle on a little fresh thyme and bake for 45 to 55 minutes, or until golden brown and a tester inserted comes out clean. Let stand for at least 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</span><br />
