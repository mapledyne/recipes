                <span itemprop="description">
	Looking for something special to bring to a Fourth of July cook-out? Check out this American Flag Pie! It’s a sheet-pan slab pie with a homemade crust and a blueberry and strawberry filling, topped with stars and stripes.

Slab pies are shallower than regular pies, but they make up for it in width. A 13 x18 sheet pan pie will easily feed 12 people, perfect for a party.

While conceivably you could use a prepackaged folded frozen pie crust (just get four of them and cut them to fit the rectangular sheet pan, and cut out the shapes), I strongly encourage you to try the home made crust recipe I’ve included for this pie.

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 1/2 cups flour</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 1/2 teaspoons sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 teaspoons salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">14 ounces butter, cut into cubes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">7/8 cup sour cream</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 1/2 pounds strawberries, hulled, quartered</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons orange zest</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 Tbsp cornstarch or flour</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pint blueberries</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 Tbsp sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon cinnamon</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon lemon zest</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons lemon juice</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 Tbsp cornstarch or flour</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg white</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon milk or cream</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1 Make the pie dough: Cut the butter into cubes and let sit out for a 10 minutes to take the chill off. Whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add the butter and toss to coat with the flour. Using your (clean) hands, work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles a coarse meal.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add the sour cream and mix with a fork until well incorporated.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Knead with your hands until the mixture comes together as a ball. Divide into 3 equal sized balls of dough (it helps to use a kitchen scale).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Form the balls into rectangular discs. Sprinkle with a little flour and wrap individually with plastic wrap.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Chill for 1 to 2 hours or overnight (can freeze this point if making several days ahead).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2 Make berry fillings: Put the quartered strawberries in a large bowl and toss with sugar, cornstarch (or flour, or minute tapioca), and orange zest.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a separate smaller bowl, put the blueberries, sugar, cinnamon, lemon zest, lemon juice, and cornstarch (or flour or minute tapioca), and toss to combine.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3 Roll out the dough for the bottom crust: Line the bottom of a 13 x 18-inch rimmed sheet pan with parchment paper.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove two dough discs from the refrigerator and let sit for 10 minutes to soften a bit. On a clean, lightly floured surface, roll out one disk to 8 x 11-inches and arrange on half of the sheet pan, with an inch of edge over the sides of the sheet pan.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Roll out the second disc and cover the other half of the sheet pan.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Fold the dough over along the edges and crimp.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove any excess dough from center. Form into a ball, then use your hands to roll into a long rope. Crimp that rope of dough and form a rectangle in one corner of the sheet pan. This is where your berries and stars will go. The dough will help keep the blueberries from running into the strawberries. (If you don't have excess dough at this point, no worries, you will later when you cut away the stars and stripes.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Put in the refrigerator to chill.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4 Make egg wash: In a small bowl, whisk together the egg white and milk or cream.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5 Roll out dough for stars and stripes: Remove third rectangular disc of dough from the fridge and let sit for 10 minutes to soften a bit. Roll out so that the longest point is 18-inches.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Use a dinner knife (blunt) or a pizza wheel to cut out stripes. You'll need 2 stripes that are about 18 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide, and 2 stripes that are about 10 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Use a star shaped cookie cutter to cut out stars.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place stars and stripes on a cookie sheet, sheet pan, or large plate. Brush with egg wash. Chill.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6 Preheat oven to 450°F.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7 Fill the pie and top with stars and stripes: Spread the strawberries over the part of the sheet pan where the red and white stripes should be. Scoop the blueberries into the corner where the stars should be.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Arrange the stars and strips of dough on top of the berries to form the flag. Chill for 10-15 minutes before baking.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">8 Bake: Bake at 450°F for 15 minutes. Then tent with foil and lower the heat to 375°F and bake for another 45 to 55 minutes or longer, until the filling is bubbling.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove from oven and let cool at least an hour before serving.</span><br />
