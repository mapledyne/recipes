                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup grain, uncooked millet or other favorite</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup chimichurri or pesto, or other favorite flavorful sauce</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound mushrooms, cremini or baby bella</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 heads romaine lettuce</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 bunch onions, green</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 sausages, chicken or pork, any favorite kind</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt and pepper</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Cook the grains: Prepare the grains according to package instructions, letting them cook while you prepare the rest of the recipe.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">The grains can be cooked several days in advance. Reheat before serving.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Preheat your grill: Prepare one side of the grill for direct grilling and one side for indirect heat. The grill is ready when you can hover your hand 3 to 4 inches above the hot side of the grill for only a couple of seconds before feeling discomfort.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Prepare the vegetables for grilling: Cut smaller mushrooms into halves and larger mushrooms into thick, 3/4-inch slices. Skewer the mushrooms through the stem, from bottom to top, so they will lay flat on the grill.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cut the heads of romaine into quarters through the root. The wedges should remain attached at the root; it's ok if a few outer leaves fall off (save those for sandwiches!).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a small bowl, mix two and a half tablespoons olive oil with a heavy pinch of salt and black pepper. Brush the oil evenly over all of the mushrooms, the green onions, and the romaine, and set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Grill the sausages and mushrooms: Brush grates with a bit of extra oil and place the sausages and mushrooms on the cooler side of the grill.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Close the lid and cook for 5 minutes, then flip the sausages and mushrooms. Close the lid and cook for another 3 to 5 minutes, or until sausages are almost entirely cooked through. (If your sausages are pre-cooked, they just need to be warmed through.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Move the sausages and mushrooms to the hot side of the grill and cook on each side for 1 to 2 minutes until they show grill marks and are caramelized.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Transfer the sausages and mushrooms to a platter to rest while you grill the rest of the vegetables.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Grill the green onions and romaine: Place the green onions and romaine halves on the hot side of the grill, and grill for about one minute on each side.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Transfer to a serving platter.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. To serve: Slice each sausage into three large pieces. Fill each bowl with 1/2 to 1 cup of cooked grains and top with a few pieces of sausage, some green onions, some mushrooms, and a wedge of romaine. Drizzle with chimichurri and top with fresh herbs.</span><br />
