                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	Very lightly adapted from Karen Solomon's Asian Pickles. Solomon calls for a pint canning jar. I had trouble fitting the carrots sticks in a pint and used a quart instead. If you do that, you will need extra liquid -- simply double the brine and the water. But don't double the five-spice powder unless you're also doubling the quantity of carrots. 

 This pickle can be canned, although the recipe below is for the refrigerated version. (For canning instructions, see the recipe in Asian Pickles.)

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces carrots</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 garlic clove, smashed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon five-spice powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup lemon juice, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons white vinegar, distilled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup water</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Peel and trim the carrots, then cut them into sticks roughly 4 inches long and 1/2 inch thick.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Place the garlic in a pint canning jar. Then, standing the sticks upright, pack them as tightly as possible into the jar. (See the note above if you find this difficult.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. In a small saucepan, stir together the five-spice powder, salt, lemon juice, and vinegar (but not the water). Bring to a boil, stir again, and immediately pour the brine over the carrots. Then boil the water in the same pan and pour in as much as you need to fill the jar.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Cap the jar and shake gently. Place it in the refrigerator and let it sit for three days to let the flavor develop, shaking occasionally. The carrots will remain good for about three months.</span><br />
