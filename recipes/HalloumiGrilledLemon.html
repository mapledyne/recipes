                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	An impressive looking vegetarian dish that needs no special skills, equipment and does not take ages to make. Originally from Laura Santtini’s book 'Flash Cooking' which was sent to me to review, I have changed the cooking method and flavors to suit my own store cupboard.  (less) —Amee

Food52 Review: WHO: Amee is an illustrator and designer living in Ireland. 
WHAT: A delicious first course, lunch, or snack -- made in ten minutes, flat. 
HOW: Whisk together a dressing, rub it into your lemon slices and halloumi, and broil. 
WHY WE LOVE IT: We love the sweet-sour-herby-cheesiness going on in this dish; you'd never know how simple it is. We'd love this over a salad, or as an hors d'oeuvre, or served simply as a first course. Feel free to swap in fresh herbs -- or, when it's warm out, throw it on the grill.
