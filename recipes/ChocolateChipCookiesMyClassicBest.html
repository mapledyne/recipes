                <span itemprop="description">
	In the category of "Great Chocolate Chip Cookies," these get my vote for the greatest. They are Toll House cookies' kin, but I think my nips, tucks, tweaks, and variations on the classic recipe make them their own kind of wonderful. They're thin and crisp and a bit chewy in the center from just the right mix of sugar—granulated sugar for crispiness and brown sugar for deep caramel flavor. 

I've made these cookies with just about every kind of chocolate known to humankind with universally satisfying results, but my all-time favorite way is to chop up premium chocolate, not worrying about cutting it into uniform sizes or shapes. Having chunks, chips, and slivers makes the eating more fun, and I love the way the mishmash of shapes looks when the cookies are baked—streaked, marbled, tweedy, and totally tempting.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 teaspoon baking soda</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 sticks (8 ounces) butter, unsalted, at room temperature</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2/3 cup (packed) sugar, light brown</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons vanilla extract, pure</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 eggs, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped into chips, or 2 cups chocolate chips or chunks</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup walnuts or pecans, finely chopped</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 375° F. Line two baking sheets with parchment or silicone mats.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Whisk together the flour, salt, and baking soda. Working with a stand mixer, preferably fitted with a paddle attachment, or with a hand mixer in a large bowl, beat the butter on medium speed for about 1 minute, until smooth. Add the sugars and beat for another 2 minutes or so, until well blended. Beat in the vanilla. Add the eggs one at a time, beating for 1 minute after each egg goes in. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the dry ingredients in 3 portions, mixing only until each addition is incorporated. On low speed, or by hand with a rubber spatula, mix in the chocolate and nuts. (The dough can be covered and refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen. If you'd like, you can freeze rounded tablespoonfuls of dough, ready for baking. Freeze the mounds on a lined baking sheet, then bag them when they're solid. There's no need to defrost before baking—just add a minute or two to the baking time.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Spoon the dough by slightly rounded tablespoonfuls onto the baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches between spoonfuls.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Bake the cookies—one sheet at a time and rotating the sheet at the midway point—for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they are brown at the edges and golden in the center; they may still be a little soft in the middle, and that's just fine.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Pull the sheet from the oven and allow the cookies to rest for 1 minute, then carefully, using a wide metal spatula, transfer them to the racks to cool to room temperature.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Repeat with the remainder of the dough, cooling the baking sheets between batches.</span><br />
