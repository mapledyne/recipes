                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	This was one of the first quiches I ever made, it remains one of my go-tos and I suspect it always will. One of my favorite parts about it is the accessibility of the ingredients. In some lucky cases, I already have them on hand, but that may just be because many of the ingredients are the core ones in my everyday cooking.

It’s also one of these gorgeous recipes that’s impossible to break. I have made it with different cheeses and it still worked. For an Atkins-prone family member, I have baked it in a greased glass quiche pan without a crust. I have swapped the light cream with heavy, and gone in the opposite direction and used skim milk or even evaporated low fat milk. I have used red or white onions instead of scallions; I have added a smashed clove of garlic. I have par-baked the crust, but I generally don’t bother and don’t find it particularly soggy. I have used a homemade tart shell and I have used a store-bought one, but I will not admit which one I worked with yesterday.
