                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	Adapted a little from Gourmet

In the original recipe, many commenters found that they wanted more garlic; I had very new garlic from the market and found one clove to be plenty booming with flavor, but definitely adjust to your taste. Many found that they liked the sauce more the longer it marinated. I’d planned to let it just sit the 10 suggested minutes, but then real life happened and it sat an hour. It was wonderful. I realized I had no lemon (of course) after returning from the store and used red wine vinegar instead. It works just fine. Lastly, the original recipe calls for coring tomatoes and I realized that I wasn’t sure whether this mean to just remove the stem and any tough parts it attaches to inside the tomato or to do as this video shows. I did a mix of both, coring fully, then squeezing the seeds and extra juices from the core before chopping them too. I’d recommend this so the sauce isn’t excessively watery, and especially if you, like me, find tomato seeds a little bitter and bothersome in sauces.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 pounds tomatoes, fresh, best-quality, (results are uneven with less fresh ones)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 small garlic clove, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice or red wine vinegar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon coarse salt, plus more to taste (I used 2 teaspoons salt, kosher</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon sugar, (optional, I found this unnecessary)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound pasta, dried capellini or angel-hair spaghetti</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup basil, fresh, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">to serve cheese, ricotta salata, grated (my choice) or Parmigiano-Reggiano and a drizzle of your favorite olive oil</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Halve the first pound of tomatoes crosswise, then rub the cut sides against the large holes of a box grater set in a large bowl, discarding the skin. Core (see note up top) and chop the last two pounds of tomatoes and add to the grated tomato bowl. Add garlic, lemon juice or vinegar, salt, sugar (if using) and pepper and let marinate at room temperature until ready to use, at least 10 minutes but also up to 2 hours if you’re planning ahead. After it has steeped for a while, taste and adjust seasonings as needed.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cook pasta in salted boiling water as package time recommends. Drain then toss with fresh sauce and basil. Serve lukewarm (as it is now) or at room temperature with a drizzle of olive oil and freshly grated cheese on top.</span><br />
