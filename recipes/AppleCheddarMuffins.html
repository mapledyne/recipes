                <span itemprop="description">
	These muffins were my attempt to capture the feelings and flavors I get from sitting in a pile of crunchy leaves on an autumn day with a crisp apple, a block of sharp cheddar, and a knife. Which is actually something I do. I love it. But, for times I can't sit in a leaf pile, I wanted a muffin. Makes sense, right? So, I whipped up these apple cheddar muffins. Barely sweet, hearty and nutty, lightly spiced, and all together delightful. Maybe not quite as good as the leaf pile, but darn close. And they were enthusiastically toddler approved!

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup flour, all-purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup flour, barley or whole wheat</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon baking soda</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon baking powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon salt, fine sea</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pinch nutmeg, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup cheese, coarsely grated sharp cheddar, or in small cubes if you prefer more discreet pockets of cheese as opposed to threads throughout</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 eggs, large, lightly beaten</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons honey</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons molasses or maple syrup</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup yogurt, full-fat Greek plain</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups apples, preferably of a nice fallish sweet-tart variety, grated</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Heat your oven to 350° F. Grease a standard muffin pan and line the cups with liners.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. In a medium mixing bowl, stir together the flours, baking soda and powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Toss in the cheese to evenly distribute.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, honey, molasses, oil, and yogurt then stir in the grated apple until everything is well combined. Gently stir the wet ingredients into the dry just until there are no streaks of dry left.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Divide the batter evenly between the muffin cups and put the muffin pan on a rimmed baking sheet in case of any dripping while the muffins bake. Bake the muffins until a tester comes out clean -- about 30 to 35 minutes. Allow to cool for about 10 minutes in the pan then transfer the muffins to a wire rack to cool. Or gobble them up warm with lots of butter.</span><br />
