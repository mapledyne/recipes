<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup bread crumbs</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons whole wheat flour</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 garlic cloves, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons olive oil, extra virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound (about 2 1/4 cups) tomatoes, cherry or grape</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons olive oil, extra virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon salt, kosher, Diamond Crystal brand (exact)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">A few grinds black pepper, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 ounces goat cheese, soft</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons chives, fresh, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon dill, fresh, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon tarragon, fresh, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">A few grinds black pepper, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons milk</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a bowl, toss the zucchini with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and set aside for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain by squeezing the zucchini in cheescloth or fine-weave kitchen towel. When finished, you should be left with about 1 1/2 cups of relatively dry shredded zucchini.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a large bowl, combine the farro, eggs, remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt, green onions, parsley, thyme, bread crumbs, flour, garlic, and zucchini. Stir well and let stand for 5 minutes. Knead the mixture a few times in the bowl with your hands, then form 3-inch patties, about 3/4 inch thick, and place them on a plate to await cooking.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">To make zucchini cakes: Line a large plate with paper towels. Pour the olive oil into a large heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat. One the oil is hot almost shimmering, put 4 of the patties in the pan and cook until the bottom is golden brown, about 4 minutes. Flio and cook the second side for 3 to 4 minutes. Place the cooked cakes on the lined plate to drain off any excess oil. Repeat with the remaining patties, adding a little extra oil as needed between batches if the cakes begin to stick to the pan.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">You can also bake the cakes ahead of time and reheat them to serve.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">To roast the tomatoes: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Arrange the tomatoes on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil so each tomato is covered nicely, and sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Bake until the tomatoes become shriveled, a bit browned on the edges, and incredibly soft and juicy, about 3 hours. Stir every hour or so to ensure they're still covered in olive oil.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">To prepare the goat cheese: Put the cheese, chives, dill, tarragon, and pepper in a small bowl and use the back of the spoon to mash the herbs into the cheese. Add the milk and stir vigorously to soften the cheese.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">To assemble: Serve warm or at room temperature. Top each cake with a generous dollop of herbed goat cheese and a spoonful of juicy roasted tomatoes.</span><br />
