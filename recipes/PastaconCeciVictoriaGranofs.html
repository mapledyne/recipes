                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	It’s astonishing how much comfort you can derive—fast—out of basic ingredients you’ve used a thousand times. Here are the keys: First, you need to use all of the olive oil—it gives the soup substance and body, carries the other flavors, and makes up for the fact that you’re making an otherwise austere soup without a rich stock. As Granof says, “It’s what’ll make you think you’re on a balcony in Naples when you eat this.” Second, cook the garlic in the oil until it’s actually browned a bit, not simply softened. This makes the flavor toasty and nutty, and not bitter, despite what nonna might say. You can leave this as soupy or stewy as you like. Granof makes it for her son once a week. "I used to give him Parmesan rinds to teethe on, and when he no longer needed to teethe, I started throwing them in this pasta." Adapted slightly from Chickpeas by Victoria Granof

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 tablespoons olive oil, extra-virgin, plus more for drizzling</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons tomato paste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon salt, kosher, or more to taste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups chickpeas, cooked</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup pasta, ditalini</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups water, boiling</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">red pepper flakes, for serving</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a large heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil until it shimmers. Add the garlic and cook, stirring until it becomes lightly browned and fragrant.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Stir in the tomato paste and salt and fry for 30 seconds or so. Add the chickpeas, pasta, and boiling water. Stir to scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the pot, lower the heat, and simmer until the pasta is cooked and most of the liquid has been absorbed, about 15 to 20 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Taste and adjust seasoning. To serve, ladle the pasta into shallow bowls, sprinkle with crushed red pepper flakes, and drizzle a bit of extra-virgin olive oil on top.</span><br />
