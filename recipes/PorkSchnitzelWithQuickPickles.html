                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 limes</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 large cucumber, english, thinly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup fennel bulb, very thinly sliced (save the fronds for garnish)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 large shallot, thinly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon brown sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">For the pork cutlets:</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup flour, all purpose</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/8 teaspoon cayenne</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/8 teaspoon nutmeg, freshly grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 eggs, beaten</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 cups panko crumbs</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/4 pounds pork cutlets, boneless, pounded to 1/8-inch thick</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Coarse kosher salt and ground black pepper</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Safflower, peanut or vegetable oil, for frying</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 scallions (green onions), thinly sliced including greens</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">for serving Lingonberry jam, (optional)</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Prepare the pickles: Grate the zest from one of the limes and juice them both. Add zest and juice to a shallow bowl along with the remaining pickle ingredients and toss well. Let sit for at least 30 minutes and up to 3 days. Chill if letting them sit for longer than 4 hours.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Meanwhile, prepare the pork: Mix flour with cayenne and nutmeg. Place flour mixture in one shallow dish, place eggs in a second dish, and place bread crumbs in a third dish. Season pork cutlets generously with salt and pepper.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Heat 1/8 inch oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. While oil heats, dip cutlets one by one into flour (shake off any excess), then into eggs (ditto) and finally into the bread crumbs, taking care not to handle pork more than necessary (hold meat by ends).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. When oil sizzles when a pinch of bread crumbs is thrown in, add as many cutlets as comfortably fit in one layer, leaving plenty of room around them. Swirl and tilt pan so oil cascades over top of cutlet in waves. When bottom is golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes, flip and brown the other side, swirling pan (swirling helps create air pockets, giving you lighter schnitzel). Transfer to a paper-towel-lined baking platter or baking tray and sprinkle with more salt. Repeat with remaining pork.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Serve pork sprinkled with scallion and drizzled with a little of the pickle juice, accompanied by the pickles and the lingonberry jam, if you like.</span><br />
