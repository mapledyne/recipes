	Leftover butternut squash was the inspiration for this recipe. Nice with a cup of coffee or tea..... —inpatskitchen

Food52 Review: WHO: Inpatskitchen is a longtime community member with a whopping 388 recipes on Food52! 
WHAT: Super-soft, super-buttery, lightly sweet rolls that also use up your leftover roasted squash. 
HOW: Add mashed roasted squash to a buttery yeast dough, form the dough into rolls, roll each piece of dough in melted honey-butter, and bake. 
WHY WE LOVE IT: These brown butter butternut rolls (try saying that 10 times fast!) are delicious, a perfect combination of squash, nutty browned butter, a touch of honey, and a hint of sea salt. They're a bit like a cross between dinner rolls and monkey bread—which is to say, we would definitely bake them again.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">18 tablespoons butter</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cups bread flour, plus more for kneading</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 1/4 teaspoons yeast, rapid rise</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon salt, fine sea</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup brown sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup milk, whole</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup butternut squash, cooked and puréed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons honey, divided</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. In a medium saucepan, melt the 2 sticks of butter over medium heat until the butter foams and begins to brown. You want a light brown color. Cool and refrigerate to solidify.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Once the butter has solidified, bring it back to room temperature so that it's soft and spreadable.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. In a large mixing bowl, whisk the flour, yeast, salt, and brown sugar together.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Warm the milk and 4 tablespoons of the brown butter until the butter has barely melted. Whisk in the egg and stir in the squash.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Stir the milk mixture into the flour mixture until incorporated. The dough will be sticky. Add more flour, a little at a time, and knead the dough for about 10 minutes. (I knead right in the bowl.) The dough may be a little sticky still, but that's okay.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Turn the dough into another large mixing bowl which has been sprayed with cooking spray. Cover and let rise in a warm area until doubled in bulk.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Melt 1/4 cup of the solidified brown butter and stir in one tablespoon of honey in a small bowl.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">8. Line a 9- or 10-inch round baking pan with parchment. Punch the dough down and then roll it to form a log about 24 inches long. Cut the log into 22 to 24 pieces. They can be various sizes... Consider them "rustic"!</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">9. Roll each piece of dough in the brown butter-honey mixture, and then place each piece in your pan. It will be crowded. Cover and let the rolls rise for 45 minutes to an hour.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">10. Preheat your oven to 350° F. Bake the rolls for 30 to 35 minutes until golden.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">11. While the rolls are baking, combine any remaining brown butter with the extra 2 tablespoons of regular butter and the remaining tablespoon of honey. Once the rolls are done, let them cool a few minutes and serve with the spreadable honey butter.</span><br />
