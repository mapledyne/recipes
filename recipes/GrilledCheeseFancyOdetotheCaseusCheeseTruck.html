                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 slices sourdough bread</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 ounces cheese of your choice, shredded or thinly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">butter, unsalted, softened</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 sage leaves, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon Parmigiano Reggiano, grated with a microplane grater</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">cornichons, or regular pickles</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Heat a non-stick skillet on medium/medium-low heat. Spread one side of bread with butter -- don't be shy. Press two sage leaves on the butter, and swipe the leaves with a little more butter so they adhere. Repeat with second slice of bread.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Lay one slice of bread in hot pan, butter and sage side down. Place cheese on the bread in the pan. Top with second slice of bread, butter and sage side up. Grill for a few minutes. You’ll hear the butter start to sizzle. Carefully check bottom of sandwich; you’re looking for golden-brown.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. With a spatula, carefully flip the sandwich, and cook for another few minutes, again looking for golden-brown. Sprinkle the top of the sandwich with half of the Parmigiano, making sure to cover the sage leaves. Flip the sandwich back over and cook for a few seconds to crisp the Parmigiano. (Don’t leave it too long or the Parmigiano will burn.) Sprinkle the rest of the Parmigiano on the top slice and flip once more to crisp that side -- a few more seconds and you’re done!</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Serve with cornichons, or their cheaper cousin the dill pickle, mustard, and a cold glass-bottled Coke.</span><br />
