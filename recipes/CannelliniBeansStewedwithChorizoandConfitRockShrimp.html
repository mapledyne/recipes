                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	This dish brings together three of my favorite ingredients: chorizo, confit rock shrimp, and stewed beans. The flavors are deeply savory and warm. This dish is perfect for the cold weather. 

The confit rock shrimp will yield excess “shrimp oil.” Save this oil in your refrigerator for up to a week and use it to sauté greens, fry an egg, or dress pasta. The flavor of the shrimp oil is fantastic. 

If you feel like getting creative, you can replace the shrimp and chorizo with anything you want, including roasted peppers, caramelized onions, roasted tomatoes, charred octopus, pancetta, etc. Bold flavors work best.

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">400 grams beans, dried cannellini</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound sausage, fresh chorizo</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 leek, large white and light green parts only, cleaned and sliced into thin half-moons</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 lemon</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 chives, chopped, handful thinly cut (to garnish)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound shrimp, cleaned rock</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">black pepper, freshly ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 strips lemon zest, strips of taken with a vegetable peeler</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 clove garlic, lightly crushed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pinch chili flakes, dried</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">a few sprigs thyme, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 bay leaf</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">olive oil</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. To make the stewed beans, begin by soaking the beans in water overnight. Use at least three times as much water as the volume of the beans.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Remove the chorizo meat from its casing. Set a large pot over high heat, and add the olive oil. When the oil begins to lightly smoke, add the chorizo. Let it cook undisturbed for 1 minute. The longer you wait to stir the chorizo, the more color and flavor will develop. When the chorizo is nicely browned on one side, use a wooden spoon to stir the chorizo, breaking it into small pieces. When the chorizo is fully cooked through and broken into small pieces, add the leeks. Season with a pinch of salt and reduce the heat to low. Stir every few minutes until the leeks have softened significantly.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. When the leeks appear soft, use a colander to strain the beans. Add the beans to the pot on the stove, and add enough fresh water to cover the beans by approximately 1 inch. Bring the liquid in the pot to a boil, then reduce the heat so that the beans are just barely simmering. Cook, uncovered, for 1 hour. After one hour, stir the beans and season with a few pinches of salt. Continue cooking for approximately 1 additional hour. When the beans are very tender, remove them from the heat. If the beans are not tender but the liquid is nearly evaporated from the pot, add more water as necessary. When the beans are finished, there should be a little liquid left in the pot, reminiscent of a stew. Add the juice of one lemon. Taste the beans and adjust with more salt and/or more lemon juice as necessary.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. While the beans are cooking, prepare the confit rock shrimp. Add the shrimp to a medium-sized pot and season them with salt and freshly ground pepper. Add the lemon zest, garlic, dried chili flakes, fresh thyme, and bay leaf. Add enough olive oil so that the rock shrimp are just barely submerged. Set the pot over the lowest heat possible. You want to cook the shrimp slowly. The slower you cook the shrimp, the more tender they will become. Stir the shrimp every few minutes, and start checking for doneness after about 20 minutes. When the shrimp are fully cooked through, remove them from the heat. If you choose to make the confit rock shrimp ahead of time and store it in your refrigerator, remember to reheat the shrimp slowly and gently.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. To serve, ladle some of the beans into a bowl. Garnish with a few spoonfuls of rock shrimp confit and a sprinkle of chives. Add an extra drizzle of the oil used to cook the rock shrimp. Enjoy.</span><br />
