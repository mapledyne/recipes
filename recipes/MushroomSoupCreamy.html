	With this recipe, MrsWheelbarrow takes a classic home cook recipe and elevates it to elegant dinner party fare. First, she has you make a reinforced stock by simmering the mushroom stems in chicken broth. Then, in a move that evokes the fastidiousness of culinary school, she instructs you to "beautifully and precisely chop" 1 1/2 pounds of mushroom caps into a 1/2-inch dice. Halfway through, you will likely be cursing both her and us, but trust us: it's worth it. And that's really the bulk of the work. The chopped mushrooms slowly cook down with shallots, thyme and rosemary, and then you deglaze them with a generous swig of Cognac, combine the mushrooms with the reinforced stock and finish with a swirl of cream and a heap of freshly chopped chives. The resulting soup is a lovely balance of delicately creamy and intensely mushroomy, with layered undertones of herbs and Cognac.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound mushrooms, mixed, cleaned, stems separated from caps</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound mushrooms, cremini, cleaned, stems separated from caps</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cups shallots, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 sprigs thyme</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 sprig rosemary</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup cognac or sherry</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt & Pepper</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 cups chicken stock, homemade or store-bought</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cups cream, whipping</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cups chives, chopped</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Rough chop the mushroom stems and simmer them, covered, in the chicken broth for about an hour.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. In the meantime, heat the oil in a large skillet, and saute the shallots until transparent. Add the herbs and salt & pepper liberally.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Beautifully and precisely chop the mushroom caps into a 1/2" dice. Add them to the shallots as they are chopped. Keep the heat very low and cook gently until the mushroom liquid is released and reabsorbed. Shake the pan so they don't stick. Remove the thyme and rosemary.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Turn up the heat and add the cognac. Flame it if you're feeling really chef-y. Cook the mushroom cap/shallot mixture down (after cognac) until well reduced and starting to turn a little golden on the edges.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Strain the mushroom stems from the chicken broth.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Add the beautiful mushroom cap and shallot mixture to the strained broth and heat gently.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Swirl in the cream and chives and serve. Or serve in small sipping cups topped with chives and lightly whipped cream, if you want to get fancy.</span><br />
