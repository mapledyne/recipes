                <span itemprop="description">
	It's amazing how a few simple ingredients can yield a delicious, filling, and comforting meal. Renee Kemps' recipe works deliciously as a side or a light meal. The combination of creamy sweet potato with the tangy goat cheese and chickpeas is satisfying and flavorful. I could not find fresh coriander anywhere so I subbed a combination of fresh cilantro and flat leaf parsley and it was the perfect garnish to finish this dish. I loved the combination of flavors and enjoyed this as a great light lunch and then again as a side with a roasted chicken breast
