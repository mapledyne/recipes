                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	There’s just enough bacon to give the white bean soup plenty of flavor, but not so much as to weigh you down. We’ve puréed about half of the soup so that it is chunky, with a creamy based that comes from the beans. Enjoy!

In this recipe we are making the bean soup starting with dry beans that we soak overnight. If you don't have time to soak beans overnight, you can put the beans into a pot of water, bring the water to a boil, remove from heat, and let sit for hour, and then drain.

If you would rather work with canned beans, use 3 to 4 15-ounce cans of drained white beans and cook them in step 3 for only 15 minutes, not an hour.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound beans, dry Great Northern white, covered with a couple inches of water and soaked overnight</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 ounces bacon, cut into 1/2-inch wide pieces</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups onion, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 cup celery, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 cup carrots, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cloves garlic, minced (about 1 tablespoon)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 cups chicken stock</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 bay leaves</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 Tbsp thyme, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon black pepper</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 Tbsp tomato paste</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon paprika</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 ounce bacon, cooked and crumbled for garnish (optional)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 Tbsp parsley, fresh, (optional - for garnish)</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1 Drain the beans that have been soaking in water. (If you haven't already soaked the beans, and you don't have time to do so overnight, you can put them in a large pot of water, bring to a boil, remove from heat and let sit for an hour, then drain.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2 Put the bacon into a large (5 to 6 quart) thick-bottomed Dutch oven on medium high heat. Let the bacon cook for a minute or two to start rendering out some of its fat, then add the chopped onion, celery, and carrots. Lower the heat to low, cover and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, until vegetables are completely cooked through and softened. Add the garlic and cook a minute more.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3 Add the drained beans to the pot. Add the stock, the bay leaves, thyme, salt and pepper. Increase heat to high to bring to a simmer, then lower the heat to maintain a simmer, partially covered, for 1 hour or until the beans are very soft.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Stir in the tomato paste and the paprika. Cook for 5 more minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4 Using an immersion blender, purée most of the soup. You don't want the soup to be perfectly smooth, but you want to purée enough of it so that the beans create a creamy base.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add more salt and pepper to taste.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Garnish with crumbled cooked bacon and chopped parsley.</span><br />
