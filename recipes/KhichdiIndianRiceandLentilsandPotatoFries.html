                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	For many Indians, khichdi—a one-pot meal of rice cooked with lentils and vegetables—is a comfort food and a diet staple. There are hundreds of recipes for preparing it and hundreds of ways of consuming it. Many Bengalis enjoy khichdi with an assorted platter of deep-fried vegetables and fried fish, while others serve it with either pickles or yogurt. 

The consistency of this khichdi will be a little runny like shown in the pictures. Using 8 cups water is fine, if you want to consume the whole amount right away. However if you're planning to refrigerate and re-heat later, you need to add 10 cups of water otherwise the khichdi will turn into a lump of rice and lentil upon refrigeration. The taste of this khichdi is not going to be super spicy but If you want spicy, you can increase the amount of red chiles and ginger in the recipe. Remember, this is a particular style recipe where spices are not used very much.
