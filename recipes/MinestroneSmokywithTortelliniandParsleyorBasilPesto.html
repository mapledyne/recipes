                <span itemprop="description">
	I love a good minestrone...so much veggie goodness, but so hearty, too. This recipe starts with just a little bit of all-natural bacon, but if you'd rather leave it out, go ahead and proceed with the rest of the recipe. You won't get the smoky flavor, but you'll still get a great soup (you could also substitute pancetta for the bacon, but obviously you won't do that if you are a vegetarian!). I didn't add any salt to the soup because the bacon and my homemade chicken stock did the trick, but please add it to taste, if necessary. As for the pesto, I went the hand-chopped route here because it's a small batch, I didn't want to drag out the food processor, and I wanted to use a minimal amount of olive oil. I made the pesto with parsley, which I love, but feel free to use basil instead. You can also use your own favorite homemade or store-bought pesto instead of this one, if you prefer. - WinnieAb (less) —WinnieAb

Food52 Review: We love WinnieAb's proclivity for combining delicious, nutritious ingredients (like the many vegetables in this soup) with a touch of the indulgent (bacon, cheese tortellini). The smokiness of the bacon permeates the minestrone, imbuing the tomatoey broth with a depth of flavor it wouldn't have otherwise. The bright, rustic pesto (we used parsley, but basil would be great too) is a superb final addition, adding a garlicky, herbal kick.

<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 carrots, peeled and chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 celery ribs, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 zucchini, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 potato, peeled and chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 cups stock, vegetable or chicken, preferably homemade</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 15 oz can chickpeas, cooked, preferably organic</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 28 oz can tomatoes, San Marzano, with juice</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup kale, chopped fine</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 9-ounce package of high quality, all-natural cheese tortellini</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">vinegar, balsamic, for drizzling- optional</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">for garnish - optional cheese, Parmesan, grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup loosely packed basil or parsley</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons pine nuts, toasted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cloves garlic, peeled</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons cheese, Parmesan, grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon olive oil</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the bacon pieces and cook for a couple of minutes, until they start to brown.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Add 2 more tablespoons of oil along with the chopped onion, garlic and leek. Continue to cook, strirring occasionally, over medium heat until softened.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Add the chopped carrot, celery, zucchini, potato and stir around for a minute or two.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Add the stock, the chickpeas, and then the tomatoes, crushing them with your hands as you go. Add a few generous pinches of salt (be judicious if your stock is salted already). Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 30-40 minutes, until the potatoes are just tender.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Add the kale and the tortellini, and continue to cook over a simmer until both are tender and cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. Taste and add more salt if necessary. Serve garnished with a spoonful of the pesto, a few drops of the aged balsamic, and a generous sprinkling of grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Chop, chop, and chop the basil or parsley some more by hand until it's very fine...when you do this, you'll reduce it down to about 1/4 cup.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. As you chop the basil, start to incorporate the other ingredients and chop them fine, too, until you have a lovely, finely chopped pesto.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">8. Transfer to a small bowl and stir in the olive oil. Use as a garnish for the minestrone.</span><br />
