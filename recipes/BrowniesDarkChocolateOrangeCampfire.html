                <span itemprop="description">
	My favorite part about camping is the food.  We do backyard camping every year and have so much fun experimenting with new campfire recipes.  Here’s an easy dessert that we love and know your family will, too!  These brownies can be made either onsite or beforehand — just be sure to pack them well in a cooler if you opt the pre-made route.

                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1  per person oranges, navel</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 box brownie mix</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Slice each of the oranges in half and set them beside one another so you know which pair belongs to each other. Then, scoop out the innards of the oranges using a spoon.  Add the discarded fruit to a plastic container and save it for fresh orange juice the next morning!</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Don’t worry about being exact — in fact, leaving some bits of orange within the peels are preferable and taste great in the end.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Once done, prepare your favorite brownie mix.  We use Ghirardelli’s dark chocolate box recipe.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Pour the brownie mix into each orange half and leave the other paired half hollow.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Then, carefully cover the brownie mix-filled orange half with the empty half.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Wrap them real well with at least 2-3 layers of heavy duty tin foil.  Be careful not to tip them over; otherwise, you’d make a mess before they’re cooked.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Once the campfire’s ready, place the orange brownies in the fire for approximately 25-35 minutes. Use tongs to move them around occasionally and keep them from burning.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Once done, unwrap the oranges and dig in!  You’ll want to have a plastic fork to enjoy these brownies.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">These orange brownies are to die for.  The orange peel and leftover scrapings of the orange itself infuse into the brownies and they taste incredibly decadent.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">The great thing about this recipe is that you can substitute the brownie mix for any other kind of mixes, too — you could have orange blueberry muffins, orange cranberry muffins, etc.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">These pictures make me want to go camping again!  Hope you enjoy!</span><br />
