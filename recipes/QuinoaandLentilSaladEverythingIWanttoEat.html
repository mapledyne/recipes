<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">One 8-ounce package tempeh, cut in half widthwise, then cut into very thin   strips</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 slice bread, stale wheat, crumbled into small bits</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 handful sesame seeds</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup sunflower seeds, toasted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup pistachios, chopped toasted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 scallions, green parts only, finely chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup ricotta salata, crumbled</span><br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Preheat the oven to 425° F. In a small bowl, add the tart dried cherries, apple cider vinegar, and 2 tablespoons of hot water. Let the cherries plump up while you plow onwards.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. In a small saucepan, add the lentils, 1 1/2 cups water or vegetable broth, 1 crushed garlic clove, and a generous pinch of salt. Bring to a rapid simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat and cook, uncovered, for 20 to 30 minutes, until the lentils are cooked but not soft or mushy. Add water as needed to keep the lentils barely covered.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. In another small saucepan (I know, I'm pushing it here!), add the quinoa and 1 1/2 cups water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for 15 minutes, or until the quinoa is finished (you’ll see that the seed is translucent and the germ is a thin white circle around it).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. While the grainy and beany stuff cooks, it's time to roast the vegetables. Toss the squash and the sweet potatoes with the coriander, paprika, cayenne, the 2 remaining garlic cloves, minced, and 1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil (you want the pieces to be well-coated but not swimming). Spread onto a parchment-lined baking sheet (or two) and bake for about 30 minutes, flipping vegetables once or twice during baking, until crisp and browned in areas.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Tempeh time! Cut the block in half widthwise, then cut it into very thin (1/8-inch) strips. Coat the bottom of a pan in a thin layer of olive oil and, when hot, fry the tempeh until brown and crispy on each side (you might have to work in batches). Drain it on a plate lined with paper towels.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. When the tempeh is done, fry the bread pieces in the leftover tempeh oil until crisp and crunchy.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. HALLELUJAH: You're ready to assemble. In a big bowl, mix together the roasted vegetables, quinoa, and lentils. Drain the cherries and add those, along with the fried tempeh, bread pieces, sesame seeds, scallions, sunflower seeds, pistachios, and cheese. Season with lemon juice, olive oil, salt and pepper. Gingerly place avocado cubes on top, and season with a bit more salt.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">8. Reward yourself for you hard work!!!!</span><br />
