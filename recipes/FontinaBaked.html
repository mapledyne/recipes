                <span itemprop="description">
	My Baked Fontina recipe has become a Super Bowl tradition. There's something about a big skillet of gooey, melted cheese - with plenty of crusty bread for dipping- that gets everyone on the same team. And the best part is, it takes less than 10 minutes to make, so you don't have to stand in the kitchen cooking while everyone is watching the game!

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 pounds cheese, Italian Fontina Val d’Aosta cheese, rind removed and 1-inch-diced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup olive oil, extra-virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon thyme leaves, fresh, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon rosemary leaves, fresh, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon salt, kosher</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 bread, crusty French baguette</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Preheat the broiler and position the oven rack 5 inches from the heat.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Distribute the cubes of Fontina evenly in a 12-inch cast-iron pan. Drizzle on the olive oil. Combine the garlic, thyme, and rosemary and sprinkle it over the cheese and olive oil. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper and place the pan under the broiler for 6 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbling and starts to brown.</span><br />
