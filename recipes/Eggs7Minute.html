                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	There are many schools of thought on egg boiling, one of which holds that the words "egg" and "boil" should never share a sentence. I have eaten meticulous eggs à la David Chang, cooked in 145-degree water for 45 minutes, and I’ve eaten haphazard eggs à la my grandmother. I’ve come to believe that, if what you want is a set white and a soft yolk, simple is best: the seven-minute egg.

 It’s less fussy than poaching, able to be peeled or served from the shell, and pretty much guaranteed to be perfect, with a white that’s neither rubbery nor [shudder] runny, and a barely-cooked yolk that still runs, but slowly, like hot fudge.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">bread, toasted and cut in strips</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">All you have to do is fill a saucepan with water (enough to cover a few large eggs), bring it to a boil, ease in the eggs (I lower them on a spoon), and set a timer for exactly seven minutes. If the water threatens to boil over, lower the heat, but keep it bubbling. If the egg cracks and a little white seeps out, don’t worry; it happens. (Some people prick the shell with a pin before cooking, to let air escape, but eh, I don’t bother.)</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">When the timer goes off, drain the eggs immediately—this part is imperative—and run them under cold water until they’re cool to the touch. Victory is nigh.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Serve with toast cut into strips for dipping.</span><br />
