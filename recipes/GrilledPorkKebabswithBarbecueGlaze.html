                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	Pork tenderloin is popular because it’s lean and reasonably priced, but it lacks flavor and tends to be dry. Grilling increases flavor but only on the meat’s exterior. By cutting the tenderloin into 1-inch cubes for kebabs, we create more surface area for flavorful char. We also salt the chunks briefly to help the pork retain moisture. We toss the pork pieces in a flavorful, low-moisture glaze (which contains added cornstarch to help it cling) and thread them onto skewers. A midcooking application of glaze adds extra zing, and the brief time on the grill minimizes moisture loss.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 x 12-ounce pork tenderloins, trimmed and cut into 1-inch chunks</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1  teaspoon salt, kosher, Diamond Crystal brand (exact)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3  tablespoons ketchup</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2  tablespoons sugar, brown, packed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1  teaspoon chili powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4  teaspoon cornstarch</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4  teaspoon liquid smoke</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">pinch of cayenne pepper, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Vegetable oil spray</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Toss pork and salt together in large bowl and let sit for 20 minutes. Soak the skewers in water to prevent burning (5 mins is plenty).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Meanwhile, whisk ketchup, sugar, chili powder, cornstarch, liquid smoke, and cayenne together in bowl. Set aside 1½ tablespoons of the ketchup mixture.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Add remaining ketchup mixture to pork and toss to coat. Thread pork onto four 12-inch metal skewers, leaving ¼ inch between pieces. Spray both sides of meat generously with oil spray.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave primary burner on high and turn off other burner(s).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place skewers on hotter side of grill and grill until well charred, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip skewers, brush with reserved ketchup mixture, and continue to grill until second side is well charred and meat registers 140 degrees, 3 to 4 minutes longer. Transfer to serving platter, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 minutes.</span><br />
