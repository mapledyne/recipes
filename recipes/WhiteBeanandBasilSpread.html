                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cups (2 15 oz cans) white beans, cooked, canned</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons olive oil, extra virgin</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cloves garlic, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon black pepper, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons lemon juice, fresh</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup basil, fresh, minced</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Drain beans, reserving some of their liquid. If you prefer and milder garlic flavor, cook the garlic in the oil in a microwave oven or on the stovetop, just until it sizzles.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a food processor, whirl together the olive oil and garlic until the garlic is pulverized. Add the white beans, salt, pepper, and lemon juice and pur√©e until the beans are smooth. If the mixture is too stiff, add a tablespoon of the reserved bean mixture to make a thick but smooth spread.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Put the spread in a bowl and fold in the fresh basil. Serve at room temperature or chilled.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">VARIATION:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add fennel and sun-dried tomatoes. Before you make the spread, place five or six sun-dried tomato halves (dry, not oil cured) in a bowl and cover them with 1 1/2 cups of boiling water. Set aside to rehydrate for about 15 minutes. Make the bean spread. When the tomatoes have absorbed water and are pliable, discard the water, and mince the tomatoes. Fold the tomatoes and 1 teaspoon of ground fennel into the spread with the basil. Add more ground fennel to taste, but only after you've let the spread sit for a bit, because the fennel flavor intensifies over time.</span><br />
