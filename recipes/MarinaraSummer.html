                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 or 3 tomatoes, ripe, large</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 tablespoons olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 garlic cloves, very thinly sliced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup basil leaves, fresh, roughly chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 scant cup ricotta, sheep's milk if possible</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound pasta, rigatoni or fettucine</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">cheese, Parmesan</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Put a big pot of water on to boil. Add salt.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">If you don't mind tomato skins and seeds, or if you're in a hurry, just cut the tomatoes into large dice about the size of, well, dice. If you prefer to skin and seed the tomatoes, make tomato concasse first.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">To draw out some of the liquid and intensify the flavor, put the diced tomatoes in a colander, sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt, and let sit for 10 minutes. If you are in a hurry, skip this step.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Put the pasta in the pot of boiling, salted water. Stir frequently. This is a quick sauce so it might be done before the pasta is.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat a large skillet to low and add the oil, then the garlic. Stir a bit and add the basil and a sprinkle of salt. Raise the heat and cook the basil, stirring, until it's wilted and dark green, watching that you don't burn the garlic. Add the tomatoes, sprinkle with the salt (if you haven't already), and cook just until they loose their rawness, about 5 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">When the pasta is done, drain it and toss it in the pan with the sauce, tasting and making adjustments as needed. Toss in the ricotta if using, but don't mix it all the way - leave some streaks and lumps.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Pass the Parmesan cheese at the table.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Pasta with summer marinara can be made with halved cherry tomatoes as well, just cook them a little less.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">This sauce becomes pasta alla Norma with the addition of roasted cubes of eggplant, chopped mint, and ricotta salata instead of fresh ricotta:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the oven to 425 degrees and peel strips from the eggplant. It's nice to have some, but not all, of the skin. Cut the eggplant into 1-inch cubes, toss with oil and salt, and roast on a baking sheet until browned and very tender, about 20 minutes. When you can easily squish a cube with your finger, the eggplant will have a nice creamy texture; undercooked eggplant can have a less appealing cottony feel. Follow the recipe for summer marinara, adding some crushed red pepper flakes with the garlic. Add the roasted eggplant when the tomatoes are cooked and let the sauce simmer gently until the pasta is ready. Toss in the chopped mint and parsley and replace the fresh ricotta with crumbled or coarsely grated ricotta salata.</span><br />
