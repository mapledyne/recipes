	From  Dorie's Cookies  by Dorie Greenspan 

I have my friend Christine Beck, who is, like me, a Paris part-timer, to thank for this recipe. The cookies belong to the chewy-molasses-cookie family, but they have so much flavor and so many surprises that they transcend the familiar. For starters, there’s both crystallized ginger and powdered ginger, lots of chopped dark chocolate and an optional bit of instant espresso too, which I tacked onto the recipe because I’m an incorrigible tinkerer.

I also tinkered with the way these are baked. Classic molasses cookies are scooped, molded into balls, rolled in sugar and then pressed with a fork before baking, and you can make these cookies that way. Or you can do what I do: Mold them in muffin tins, which turn out more uniformly shaped cookies that teeter on the brink of becoming gingerbread cakes.

<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons cocoa powder, unsweetened</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 teaspoons ginger, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon cinnamon, ground</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon baking soda</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon sea salt, fine</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons; 6 ounces; 170 grams) butter, unsalted, cut into chunks at room temperature</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup (67 grams) sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup (67 grams) brown sugar, packed</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg yolk, large, at room temperature</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup (120 ml) molasses, unsulfured</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract, pure</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/3 cup (55 grams) chopped crystallized ginger or 2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger mixed with 2 tea sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">7 ounces chocolate, semisweet or bittersweet, chopped chip-size</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">sugar, for rolling</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1.Whisk the flour, cocoa, espresso (if using), spices, baking soda and salt together.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2.Working with a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large bowl with a hand mixer, beat the butter and both sugars together on medium-low speed for about 3 minutes, scraping the bowl as needed, until fully blended. Add the yolk and beat for 1 minute, then add the molasses and vanilla, beating until smooth. Turn off the mixer, add the dry ingredients all at once and pulse the mixer until the risk of flying flour passes. Working on low speed, mix the dough until the flour is almost but not completely incorporated. Add the crystallized ginger (or the sugared fresh ginger) and chocolate and mix until the dry ingredients disappear into the dough and the ginger and chocolate are evenly distributed. If you’ve got bits of dry ingredients on the bottom of the bowl, mix them in with a flexible spatula.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3.Gather the dough into a ball, flatten it and wrap it in plastic. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4.GETTING READY TO BAKE: Position the racks to divide the oven into thirds and preheat it to 350 degrees F. Butter or spray regular muffin tins or, if making free-form cookies, line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5.Have a medium cookie scoop at hand. Alternatively, you can use a rounded tablespoonful of dough for each cookie. If you’re using tins, find a jar or glass that fits into them and can be used to flatten the dough; cover the bottom in plastic wrap. Spoon some sugar into a wide shallow bowl.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6.For each cookie, mold a scoop or spoonful of dough into a ball between your palms, then turn it in the sugar to coat and put in a muffin cup or on a baking sheet, leaving 2 inches between each ball of dough. If using tins, use the jar or glass to flatten each ball until it almost reaches the sides of the cup. If it’s freeform, press to flatten to about ½ inch thick.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7.Bake the cookies for about 13 minutes, rotating the tins or sheets top to bottom and front to back after 7 minutes. The cookies should be lightly set around the edges and softer in the center. Transfer the tins or sheets to racks and let the cookies rest for 15 minutes before unmolding them and/or placing them on racks to cool completely.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">8.If you’re baking in batches, make certain to start with cool tins or baking sheets.</span><br />
