                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 cups sweet potato chunks (about 2 average-sized sweet potatoes, peeled and chopped into chunks)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Olive oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 large apple, chopped into chunks (does not need to be peeled, but can be if you prefer!)</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups onions, white pearl</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">10 sage leaves, fresh, roughly chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt and pepper</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Preheat your oven to 400Â° F. Toss sweet potatoes in a few tablespoons of olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Spread out on a lined baking sheet and roast in the oven for 5 minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. While the potatoes are roasting, heat a pan with 2 teaspoons olive oil over medium high heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally. After a few minutes, add the sage and mix in, continuing to cook. Remove from heat when onions are fragrant and browning and sage is crisping on the edges (this will continue in the oven). At this point your whole home smells like goodness and wonder and you should pour yourself a glass of wine and sigh happily, probably.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Dump the onion mix and the chopped apples onto the pan with the sweet potatoes and spread into an even layer. Return it all to the oven to roast for 10 to 15 more minutes. Remove when the sweet potatoes are cooked through.</span><br />
