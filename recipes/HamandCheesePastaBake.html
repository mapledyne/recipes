                <span itemprop="description">
	What happens when pasta meets up with a Mozzarella and Parmesan-loaded white sauce tossed with chopped ham and herbs? Magic! Belly warming, rich, cheesy magic.

There are times when all we need is a big bowl of comfort. That is exactly what we’re making here with this ham and cheese pasta bake.

I made a batch the other day and sent it home with my parents. They came back the next day to insist that I put the recipe on the site, they liked it that much.

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces pasta, fusilli</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt for pasta water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 Tbsp butter</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cloves garlic, minced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 Tbsp flour</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 1/2 cups milk</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup cream, heavy whipping</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup water</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon black pepper, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 teaspoons salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 ounces (about 1 cup, packed) cheese, Parmesan, shredded or grated</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 ounces (about 1 cup, packed) cheese, mozzarella, shredded</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">10 ounces ham, diced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup parsley, fresh, chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup onion, greens or chives, chopped</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. Make pasta: Put a big pot of salted water onto boil on high heat for the pasta (4 quarts, 2 Tbsp salt). While the pasta water is heating, prep the other ingredients.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the pasta and stir so it doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan. Let the water return to a rolling boil and cook, uncovered, for 9 to 10 minutes, until the pasta is “al dente”, cooked through but still slightly firm to the bite.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Make roux: Melt the butter in a large (3 to 4 quart), thick-bottomed pot on medium heat. Add the minced garlic. Let the garlic sizzle for a few seconds. Add the flour and whisk so that any lumps are dissolved. Let the roux (flour and butter) bubble and cook for a minute or two.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Make the sauce: Slowly add the milk and cream, a quarter cup at a time, whisking until incorporated after each addition. Increase the heat to medium high. Add ¼ teaspoon of ground nutmeg and ½ teaspoon of ground black pepper. (You may want to increase these later to taste.) Add ½ teaspoon of Italian seasoning.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add half of the shredded Mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses, whisking until melted and incorporated into the sauce.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add 3/4 teaspoon of salt (again, you may want to increase this to taste).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Stir in 1 cup of water (can use pasta cooking water if you want).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Preheat oven to 400°F.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Combine pasta with sauce, ham, parsley, onion greens: Drain the cooked pasta and add it to the sauce. Add the ham. Add the chopped parsley and onion greens or chives. Gently stir to combine. Taste, and add more nutmeg, salt, pepper, or Italian seasoning to taste.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Bake: Transfer the pasta mixture to an oven-proof casserole dish (if you are using a Dutch oven to make the sauce, there is no need to transfer to another dish). Sprinkle the top with the remaining cheese. Bake in the oven at 400°F for 10 to 15 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned on top.</span><br />
