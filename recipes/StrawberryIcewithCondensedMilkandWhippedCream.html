                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	Mostly, I haven't had much reason to buy condensed milk. But a trip to Panama changed this. After a long hike in the cloud forest, our guide took us to a local place in Boquete specializing in strawberry desserts. My eye went straight to a strawberry ice capped with condensed milk and dense whipped cream. The creamy milk quietly mediated between the fruit and cream, working its magic much like it does in coffee and cookie bars.
