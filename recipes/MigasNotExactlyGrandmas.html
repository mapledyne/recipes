                <strong>Description:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="description">
	A visit to my grandmother’s house would not be complete without a big breakfast featuring the ultimate Tex-Mex comfort food, migas. A combination of eggs and (preferably stale) corn tortillas, some migas can be a bit dense, but the version I’ve developed over the years has a light, fluffy texture. This dish isn’t going to win any beauty contests, but it’s a real favorite in our household, and it's easy to make for a crowd. I call for canned tomatoes and green chile as they are available year-round, but you can of course substitute good fresh ones in season if you prefer – just chop them and add them to the skillet to cook down rather than pureeing them. Serve these with a side of refried beans, plenty of grated cheese, and your favorite salsa.

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon oil, canola or vegetable, or rendered pork fat or bacon grease</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup onion, diced</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">kosher or sea salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon oregano, dried, preferably Mexican</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6, about 2 cups total tortillas, corn</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 clove garlic, peeled and chopped</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup tomatoes, canned whole peeled, with juice</span><br />
