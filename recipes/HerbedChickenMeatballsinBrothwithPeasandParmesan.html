                <br />

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 ounces (85 grams) rustic country-style bread</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup (60 ml) whole milk</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">18 ounces (540 grams) chicken or turkey, ground</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 sprigs Italian parsley, leaves finely chopped and stems discarded</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 sprigs marjoram, leaves finely chopped and stems discarded</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">pepper black</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 1/2 quarts (scant 2 ½ liters) chicken stock, preferrably homemade</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces (340 grams) fresh or frozen peas</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Grana Padano or Parmesan, for grating</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cut the crusts off the bread. Cut the bread into roughly ½-inch cubes, and put it into a large bowl. Add the milk, toss to coat, and leave to soak for about 20 minutes. Then squish the bread into a mush, and add the ground chicken. Add 1 tablespoon each of the chopped parsley and marjoram, a few grinds of black pepper, and a couple of very generous pinches of salt. (If you’re using table salt or fine sea salt, about 1 teaspoon should be right.) Mix with a fork, or with your hand, until evenly combined. (If you’re unsure of the seasoning, at this point you can fry off a little bit of the meat mixture and taste for salt.) With damp hands, form the meat into 1-inch balls. You should get approximately 25. Chill the meatballs for 30 minutes before cooking.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring the chicken stock to a simmer in a wide pot, such as a Dutch oven. (This is a good time to taste the stock for seasoning.) Gently drop the meatballs into the simmering stock, and cook for 5 minutes. You’re looking for their internal temperature to reach 165 degrees. Remove the meatballs from the stock, and set aside. If the broth is cloudy, you can strain it, or just continue on. You can now go one of two ways:</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. If you plan to serve the soup immediately, add the peas to the simmering stock, and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Return the meatballs to the pot, and stir in the remaining chopped herbs. Serve with freshly grated Grana Padano or Parmesan.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. If you plan to eat the soup later, chill the meatballs and the stock separately. When you’re ready to eat, bring the broth back to a simmer, add the meatballs and peas, and cook until everything is warm and the peas are tender, maybe 5 minutes. Stir in the remaining chopped herbs. Serve with freshly grated Grana Padano or Parmesan.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Yield: 4 to 6 servings</span><br />
