                <span itemprop="description">
	For Valentine's Day this year I wanted to come up with a chocolate cookie that picked up on chocolate-covered cherries. And even though I'm not a big fan of the syrupy candies, I do think tart dried cherries are the best dried fruit Mother Nature invented. So I came up with a chocolate roll-out cookie by interpolating recipes from smittenkitchen and epicurious. But for this chocoholic it was not enough; therefore I gave them a bath. In dark chocolate. Did I mention the Cointreau? The cherries get a soaking for the aromatic and softening effects. These cookies are very good on their own, but wicked good when dipped. (less) —Sadassa_Ulna

Food52 Review: WHO: Sadassa_Ulna is an architectural designer from Philadelphia. 
WHAT: A Valentine's Day cookie all grown up: dark, sultry, and boozy. 
HOW: Soak tart cherries in Cointreau, then work them into a chocolatey dough. Chill, cut, bake, and dip. 
WHY WE LOVE IT: Reminiscent of those gooey cherry cordials -- but oh, so much better -- these cookies hit that chocolate, cherry, and boozy craving that comes around each February. We've subbed in vegetable oil for the shortening in the glaze, and it still works like a charm.

                <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup cherries, tart dried</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon vanilla extract</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons Cointreau</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 ounces chocolate, unsweetened baking</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3/4 cup butter, unsalted</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1-2/3 cups sugar</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 eggs, brought to room temp.</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2-1/3 cups flour</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 cup cocoa powder, unsweetened</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon baking powder</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/2 teaspoon salt</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 teaspoon baking soda</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">7 ounces dark chocolate</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons shortening or vegetable oil</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">sugar, white pearl</span><br />
<span itemprop="recipeIngredient">chocolate, white</span><br />
                <br />

                <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />

                <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">1. In a small [microwavable] bowl, mix Cointreau and vanilla together; chop cherries into small pieces and place in bowl. Microwave for 20 seconds (or allow cherries to absorb liquid overnight).</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">2. Sift flour, cocoa, salt, baking powder and baking soda together in a medium bowl, set aside.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">3. Melt chocolate by doing the following: place in small microwavable bowl and cook for 45 seconds, then stir, then cook at 20 second intervals - stirring after each - until smooth. You can also melt your chocolate in a double boiler over boiling water. Allow to cool until comfortable to touch but still very pliable.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">4. Cream butter and sugar together with an electric mixer; add eggs and mix thoroughly. Add melted chocolate and mix until color is uniform.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">5. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients. Add cherries and mix to incorporate.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">6. Place dough between 2 long sheets of wax paper; roll with a rolling pin until almost the size of a standard cookie sheet.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">7. Chill dough for at least 45 minutes; if you are impatient and have the room stick it in the freezer.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">8. Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove top wax paper, cut the thin slab into two equal pieces and wrap one and put it back in the fridge. Roll the other half between wax paper until double the size, about 1/4 inch thick, maybe thinner.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">9. Using a cookie cutter, or a little round drinking glass, cut out cookies (or cut rolled dough into 2" squares or diamonds, etc. with a knife) and place on a parchment lined cookie sheet. bunch up scraps and re-roll; if dough gets too sticky put it in the freezer for a few minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">10. Bake for 9-12 minutes; times will vary according to size of cutouts. Cool cookies on sheet for five minutes.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">11. In a double boiler, melt the chocolate with the shortening. Drop the cooled cookies upside-down into the chocolate, and fish out with a fork and place on a rack to set. When the coated cookies lose their gloss, decorate with white pearl sugar or melted white chocolate dots if desired.</span><br />

<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">12. * I did not have "couverture" chocolate, the type used for dipping chocolate; it has extra cocoa butter, which is why I added the palm oil. I used the Trader Joe's Belgian Dark, the type that is sold in packages of three small bars. To me this type is smoother than the huge one-pound bar that TJ's sells. ** I'm not really a fan of white chocolate, but I happened to have some Valrhona white chocolate feves. I put about 10 in a tiny bowl and nuked for 15 seconds, stirred, then another 15. It worked, and being impatient I dropped dots and swirls from a teaspoon. . .</span><br />
